Keeping your Windows sign-in safe is more than just picking a good password. It means securing how the password is used, stored, and protected at every step. The techniques below use advanced capabilities built into Windows 10 and 11, explained in simple steps for beginners.

What makes a password strong on Windows? - Use length over complexity. Create a long passphrase of 14 or more characters. Four or five random words separated by dashes or spaces are easy to remember and hard to guess. - Avoid reuse. Use a unique password for your Windows account that you do not use anywhere else. - Keep it private. Do not store it in plain text files like Notepad on your desktop.

Should you use a PIN or a password for sign-in? Yes. A Windows Hello PIN is generally safer than a traditional password on the device itself. - A PIN is device-specific, so it only unlocks that one PC. - On PCs with a TPM chip, the PIN is protected in hardware, which makes it resistant to many attacks.

How to set a strong Windows Hello PIN Windows 11 1) Open Settings > Accounts > Sign-in options. 2) Under PIN (Windows Hello), select Set up or Change. 3) Check Include letters and symbols to allow a longer, mixed PIN. 4) Enter a 8–12+ character PIN. Avoid birthdays or obvious patterns.

Windows 10 1) Open Settings > Accounts > Sign-in options. 2) Under Windows Hello PIN, select Add or Change. 3) Enable letters and symbols if offered, then set a long PIN.

How do you encrypt your PC so a stolen device stays locked down? BitLocker or Device Encryption protects your files even if someone removes your drive and tries to read it elsewhere.

Windows 11/10 Home (Device encryption on supported hardware) 1) Go to Settings > Privacy & security > Device encryption. 2) Turn On. Save the recovery key to a USB drive and print a copy for a safe place.

Windows 11/10 Pro and higher (BitLocker) 1) Type Manage BitLocker in Start and open it. 2) Select Turn on BitLocker for your system drive. 3) Save the recovery key to a USB drive and print a copy. Do not save it only in your email. 4) Choose Encrypt used disk space only for speed on new PCs or Encrypt entire drive for used PCs.

Add a BitLocker startup PIN for stronger protection (Pro and higher) 1) Press Windows+R, type gpedit.msc, press Enter. 2) Go to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > BitLocker Drive Encryption > Operating System Drives. 3) Open Require additional authentication at startup and set it to Enabled, then check Allow BitLocker without a compatible TPM (requires a password or a startup key on a USB flash drive) only if you do not have a TPM. On TPM systems, enable Use TPM with PIN. 4) Return to Manage BitLocker and select Set PIN.

How do you protect the sign-in screen from spoofing and leakage? Require Ctrl+Alt+Delete before sign-in - This prevents fake sign-in screens from capturing passwords. Windows 11/10 1) Press Windows+R, type netplwiz, press Enter. 2) Open the Advanced tab, check Require users to press Ctrl+Alt+Delete.

Hide the last signed-in username Windows 11/10 Pro 1) Press Windows+R, type secpol.msc, press Enter. 2) Security Settings > Local Policies > Security Options. 3) Set Interactive logon: Do not display last user name to Enabled.

How do you stop password guessing on your PC? Set account lockout so repeated wrong attempts trigger a temporary lock.

Windows 11/10 Pro 1) Press Windows+R, type secpol.msc, press Enter. 2) Security Settings > Account Policies > Account Lockout Policy. 3) Set Account lockout threshold = 10 invalid logon attempts. 4) Set Account lockout duration = 15 minutes. 5) Set Reset account lockout counter after = 15 minutes.

Windows 11/10 Home (Command Prompt as Administrator) 1) Right-click Start > Windows Terminal (Admin). 2) Run: net accounts /lockoutthreshold:10 net accounts /lockoutduration:15 net accounts /lockoutwindow:15

How do you protect stored passwords and credentials? Clean up old passwords in Credential Manager 1) Open Control Panel > User Accounts > Credential Manager. 2) Check Web Credentials and Windows Credentials. 3) Remove entries you no longer use, especially old network shares and apps.

Turn on Local Security Authority (LSA) protection to guard credentials in memory Windows 11 (22H2 and later) 1) Open Windows Security > Device security. 2) Select Core isolation details. 3) Turn on Local Security Authority protection, then restart.

Windows 10 and earlier Windows 11 builds (Registry) 1) Open regedit and go to HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Lsa. 2) Create DWORD RunAsPPL = 1 and optionally RunAsPPLBoot = 1, then restart.

How do you handle recovery keys and password files safely? - Store BitLocker recovery keys offline on a USB drive in a safe place and keep a printed copy. - Do not email recovery keys to yourself or save them in cloud notes without encryption. - Securely destroy unneeded password files or exported lists using a shredder tool.

How can Glary Utilities help with password hygiene on Windows? [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) is a helpful privacy companion alongside Windows’ built-in security. It does not replace Windows sign-in or encryption, but it strengthens the surrounding privacy so your passwords are less likely to leak.

Practical uses - Shred sensitive files such as old password lists and BitLocker key printouts Steps: Install and open [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) > Advanced Tools > Privacy & Security > File Shredder.
