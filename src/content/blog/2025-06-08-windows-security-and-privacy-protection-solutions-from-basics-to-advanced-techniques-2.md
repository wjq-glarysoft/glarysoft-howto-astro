Protecting your Windows PC is more than just installing an antivirus. As privacy concerns and cyber threats evolve, Windows users need a layered approach—covering everything from built-in features to third-party tools and best practices. This guide offers expert recommendations, practical advice, and actionable steps for intermediate-level users aiming to boost their privacy and security.

Why Should You Care About Privacy and Security on Windows?

Your Windows PC is a hub for sensitive personal data—documents, photos, passwords, and private communications. Security breaches can lead to identity theft, financial loss, and privacy violations. Even if you have basic protections, advanced threats and privacy risks require regular, proactive management.

What Are the Built-in Windows Security Tools You Should Use?

Windows 10 and 11 come with robust built-in security features, but many users don’t use them to their full potential. Here’s how to fortify your system:

Windows Security (Windows Defender): Go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Security. Ensure Real-time protection and Cloud-delivered protection are on. Run a Full Scan monthly.

Firewall & Network Protection: The Windows Firewall blocks unauthorized access. Check its status and rules via Windows Security > Firewall & network protection. You can customize inbound/outbound rules for tighter control.

BitLocker Encryption: Protect sensitive files on your hard drives by enabling BitLocker (Pro and Enterprise editions). Find it under Control Panel > System and Security > BitLocker Drive Encryption. This helps prevent data theft from lost or stolen devices.

Windows Hello and Account Protection: Use strong PINs, passwords, or biometrics (fingerprint or face recognition) via Settings > Accounts > Sign-in options.

How Can You Secure Your Privacy Settings?

Windows collects telemetry and usage data for updates and troubleshooting, but you can control much of what’s shared:

Privacy Dashboard: Go to Settings > Privacy. Review the permissions for location, camera, microphone, and apps. Turn off access for apps you don’t trust or use.

Diagnostics & Feedback: In Settings > Privacy > Diagnostics & feedback, set data collection to “Required” only. Disable tailored experiences and feedback requests.

Activity History: Disable “Let Windows collect my activities” in Settings > Privacy > Activity history.

Microsoft Account Sync: Limit or turn off sync for settings, passwords, and browsing history under Settings > Accounts > Sync your settings.

What Advanced Steps Can You Take for Stronger Security?

Intermediate users should go beyond basics:

Local Account vs. Microsoft Account: Consider using a local account for better privacy, especially on a non-shared PC. You can switch under Settings > Accounts > Your info.

Manage User Accounts and Permissions: Use Standard user accounts for daily tasks, reserving Administrator privileges for installations or changes. This limits the damage if malware strikes.

Patch Management: Keep Windows and all software up to date. Enable automatic updates, but periodically check for updates manually, especially for third-party software.

PowerShell Hardening: Use PowerShell to audit security settings or disable potentially risky features like SMBv1 (commonly exploited in ransomware attacks).

Example command to disable SMBv1: Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName smb1protocol

Application Control: Limit app installations to those you trust. Use Windows’ App & browser control (in Windows Security) to set up reputation-based protection.

How Can You Use Glary Utilities for Enhanced Privacy and Security?

While Windows offers many tools, third-party utilities like Glary Utilities can simplify and enhance your efforts:

Privacy Cleaner: [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com)’ Privacy Cleaner scans for browsing traces, cookies, recent files, and chat logs that Windows may leave behind. Run this regularly to wipe sensitive history.

Tracks Eraser: Securely delete activity traces across browsers and applications—helpful for shared or public PCs.

File Shredder: When deleting sensitive files, use Glary’s File Shredder to overwrite and permanently erase data, making it unrecoverable even by advanced recovery tools.

Startup Manager: Review and control which programs run at startup. Disabling unnecessary items reduces attack surfaces and speeds up boot time.

One-Click Maintenance: Use Glary’s One-Click Maintenance to scan for privacy issues, registry problems, and system junk in a single step. Schedule regular scans for ongoing protection.

How Do You Secure Your Network and Online Activities?

A secure PC is only as safe as its network:

Wi-Fi Security: Always use WPA3 or WPA2 encryption with a strong passphrase for your wireless networks. Avoid public Wi-Fi for sensitive transactions, or use a VPN.

Browser Protection: Use privacy-focused browsers (like Firefox or Brave) and enable tracking protection. Regularly clear your cache and cookies—Glary Utilities can automate this process.

VPN Usage: Consider a reputable VPN service to encrypt your internet traffic, especially on public or unsecured networks.

Password Management: Don’t reuse passwords. Use a password manager to store strong, unique credentials. Windows users can use third-party managers or Microsoft’s built-in Credential Manager.

What Regular Maintenance Should You Perform?

Schedule regular security “checkups”:

Monthly: - Run a full antivirus scan. - Use Glary Utilities’ One-Click Maintenance. - Check for Windows and software updates. - Review account activity and privacy settings.

Quarterly: - Audit user accounts and permissions. - Change critical passwords. - Backup important data to an encrypted external drive or cloud service.

What Should You Watch Out For?

Phishing and Malicious Downloads: Be skeptical of unexpected emails, links, and downloads—even those that appear to come from trusted sources.

Untrusted Software: Avoid “free” utilities from unknown sites. Stick to reputable sources and verify digital signatures when possible.

Remote Access Threats: Disable Remote Desktop if not needed (Settings > System > Remote Desktop) and never share access with unknown parties.

Final Thoughts

Windows security and privacy require a proactive approach, combining built-in settings, advanced configurations, and smart use of trusted third-party tools like [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com). By following these expert recommendations and maintaining a regular protection routine, you can dramatically reduce your risk and safeguard your data—without sacrificing usability. Start with the basics, gradually implement advanced steps, and make privacy maintenance a habit for ongoing peace of mind.
