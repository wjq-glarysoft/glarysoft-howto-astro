Windows startup issues can be frustrating, especially when you're faced with a system that refuses to boot properly or keeps crashing during startup. Fortunately, there are many techniques—ranging from basic to advanced—that can help you get your PC back up and running. This article covers step-by-step solutions for all levels, focusing on Clean Up & Repair methods and highlighting the benefits of using tools like [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) for maintenance and troubleshooting.

What Are Common Windows Startup Problems?

Windows may fail to start for various reasons, including corrupted system files, faulty updates, driver conflicts, malware infections, or hardware problems. Common symptoms include blue screen errors, endless boot loops, black or blank screens, or error messages like "BOOTMGR is missing" or "Automatic Repair couldn't repair your PC."

Beginner Solutions: Simple Fixes for Startup Problems

1\. Restart Your Computer

Sometimes, a simple restart can resolve temporary glitches. If you’re stuck at the login screen or see an error message, use Ctrl + Alt + Delete to access options, or hold the power button to force a shutdown. Wait a few seconds, then turn the PC back on.

2\. Unplug External Devices

Remove USB drives, external hard disks, printers, or other peripherals before restarting. Faulty hardware or drivers for external devices can often cause startup failures.

3\. Use Windows Startup Repair

If Windows can’t boot, you’ll often see the “Automatic Repair” screen. Here’s how to use it:

\- On the Automatic Repair screen, select Advanced options. - Choose Troubleshoot, then Advanced options, then Startup Repair. - Select your user account and enter your password if prompted. - Allow Windows to attempt repairs.

4\. Run a Virus Scan in Safe Mode

Malware can prevent Windows from starting. Boot into Safe Mode and run a full scan:

\- Restart your PC and hold down F8 or Shift + F8 (on some systems, use Shift + Restart from the login screen). - Select Safe Mode with Networking. - Run your antivirus software to scan and remove threats.

Intermediate Solutions: Deeper Troubleshooting

1\. System Restore

If a recent update or software installation caused problems, System Restore can roll back your PC to a previous working state.

\- Boot into Advanced Startup Options (Shift + Restart or using a recovery drive). - Choose Troubleshoot > Advanced options > System Restore. - Select a restore point from before the issue started.

2\. Check for Disk Errors

Hard drive issues can prevent startup. Use the built-in Check Disk tool:

\- Boot into Advanced Startup Options or Safe Mode with Command Prompt. - Type chkdsk /f /r C: and press Enter. - Confirm the scan, and restart your PC.

3\. Clean Up and Repair with [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com)

Glary Utilities offers a user-friendly set of tools for repairing and optimizing startup:

\- Download and install Glary Utilities from the official website. - Open the program and select 1-Click Maintenance. - Ensure options like Registry Cleaner, Shortcuts Fixer, and Startup Manager are checked. - Click Scan for Issues. Once completed, click Repair Problems. - Use the Startup Manager tool within Glary Utilities to review and disable unnecessary startup programs that may be causing delays or conflicts.

Advanced Solutions: Fixing Persistent and Complex Startup Issues

1\. Repair Corrupted System Files

Corrupted files can cripple Windows startup. Use the System File Checker and Deployment Imaging tools:

\- Boot into Safe Mode or the Command Prompt from Advanced Startup Options. - Type sfc /scannow and press Enter. Allow the scan to complete. - For deeper repairs, type DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth and press Enter.

2\. Edit Boot Configuration Data (BCD)

Incorrect BCD settings can prevent Windows from starting.

\- From Advanced Startup Options, select Command Prompt. - Type bootrec /fixmbr and press Enter. - Type bootrec /fixboot and press Enter. - Type bootrec /scanos and press Enter. - Type bootrec /rebuildbcd and press Enter. - Restart your PC.

3\. Uninstall Problematic Updates or Drivers

Faulty updates or drivers can break startup. Here’s how to uninstall them from Safe Mode:

\- Access Safe Mode with Networking. - Open Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update > View update history > Uninstall updates. - Remove the latest updates. - For drivers, use Device Manager to roll back or uninstall recently updated drivers.

4\. Restore Windows from a System Image

If you’ve previously created a system image backup:

\- Boot into Advanced Startup Options. - Select Troubleshoot > Advanced options > System Image Recovery. - Follow the prompts to restore your PC.

Proactive Maintenance: Prevent Future Startup Problems

Routine maintenance significantly reduces the risk of startup issues. Glary Utilities can help with ongoing system health:

\- Schedule regular 1-Click Maintenance scans. - Use Disk Cleaner and Registry Repair to remove junk and fix errors. - Periodically review and optimize startup items using the Startup Manager. - Use the Software Update tool to keep critical programs and drivers up to date.

When to Seek Professional Help

If you’ve exhausted these solutions and Windows still won’t start, the problem may be severe hardware failure or unrecoverable system corruption. At this point, consult a professional repair service or consider reinstalling Windows as a last resort.

Summary

Windows startup issues can be daunting, but with the right approach and tools, most problems can be resolved. Start with basic troubleshooting, progress to intermediate repairs, and employ advanced fixes as needed. Utilizing comprehensive tools like Glary Utilities ensures your system stays optimized and less prone to startup failures. Remember, regular maintenance is the best defense against future problems.
