Monitoring and repairing system files in Windows is essential for maintaining the health and performance of your PC. If you're experiencing slowdowns, crashes, or errors, damaged or corrupted system files might be the cause. This guide will walk you through easy-to-follow methods for monitoring and repairing system files in Windows, particularly aimed at beginners.

What are System Files and Why Repair Them?

System files are critical components of the Windows operating system. They ensure everything runs smoothly by handling vital tasks and processes. If these files become corrupted, it can lead to various issues. Regular monitoring and repair can prevent potential problems.

1\. How to Use the System File Checker (SFC)?

The System File Checker is a built-in Windows utility that scans and repairs corrupted system files.

\- Press Windows + S, type 'cmd', right-click on 'Command Prompt', and select 'Run as administrator'. - In the Command Prompt, type \`sfc /scannow\` and press Enter. - The tool will scan for corrupted files and repair them automatically.

This process can take some time, so be patient. Once completed, you’ll receive a message indicating whether issues were found and if they were repaired.

2\. What is the DISM Tool and How Can I Use It?

DISM (Deployment Imaging Service and Management) is another Windows tool that can repair the Windows image, which SFC depends on.

\- Open Command Prompt as an administrator. - Type \`DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth\` and press Enter. - Wait for the process to complete, which can take 10-20 minutes.

This tool checks the health of the Windows image and repairs it, ensuring that system file repairs made by SFC are effective.

3\. Can System Restore Help?

System Restore allows you to roll back your system to a previous state when everything was running smoothly.

\- Type 'create a restore point' in the Windows search bar and press Enter. - Click on 'System Restore', choose a restore point, and follow the prompts.

This method doesn't specifically repair files but can revert recent changes that caused system file issues.

4\. How to Perform a Clean Boot?

A clean boot starts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and startup programs, helping you determine if background programs are causing problems.

\- Press Windows + R, type 'msconfig', and click OK. - Under the Services tab, check 'Hide all Microsoft services' and then click 'Disable all'. - Go to the Startup tab, open Task Manager, and disable all startup items. - Restart your computer.

After troubleshooting, revert these changes by enabling all services and startup items.

5\. Is Windows Fresh Start an Option?

Windows Fresh Start reinstalls Windows and keeps your personal files intact.

\- Go to Settings > Update & Security > Recovery. - Under Reset this PC, select 'Get started' and choose 'Keep my files'.

This process reinstalls Windows, effectively repairing system files without affecting your documents.

6\. How to Use [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) for System Repair?

Glary Utilities is a comprehensive tool that can help maintain and repair your system effortlessly.

\- Download and install [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) from their official website. - Open the program and navigate to the 'Repair' section. - Use the 'System File Checker' function to scan and repair files.

7\. What About Regular Backups?

Regular backups ensure you always have a restore point before issues arise.

\- Use the built-in File History feature or third-party backup solutions. - Navigate to Control Panel > System and Security > File History to set up and schedule regular backups.

Backups act as a safety net, allowing you to restore files to a healthy state whenever necessary.

Conclusion

By regularly monitoring and repairing system files in Windows, you can prevent many common issues and keep your PC running smoothly. Whether using built-in tools like SFC and DISM or third-party solutions like Glary Utilities, these methods are effective for maintaining a healthy Windows environment. Remember, consistent maintenance is key to a stable and efficient computer.
