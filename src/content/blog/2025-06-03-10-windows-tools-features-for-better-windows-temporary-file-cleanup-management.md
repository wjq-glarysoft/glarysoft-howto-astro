Temporary files accumulate on Windows systems over time, taking up valuable disk space and sometimes slowing down your PC. Mastering temporary file cleanup is key to keeping your computer running efficiently. This guide explores ten essential Windows tools and features—both built-in and third-party—offering expert advice, practical examples, and step-by-step instructions for users of all skill levels.

Why Manage Temporary Files?

Temporary files are created by Windows and applications for various tasks, such as software installations, updates, browsing, and document editing. While most are deleted automatically, many are left behind, leading to wasted space and potential performance issues. Regularly managing these files reduces clutter, enhances speed, and prevents errors.
