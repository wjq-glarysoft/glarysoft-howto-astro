Windows systems can develop file errors over time, leading to crashes, slow performance, or even boot failures. Fortunately, Windows offers several built-in tools and features designed to help repair system files and maintain stability. Understanding how to use these tools can make the difference between a sluggish, error-prone computer and one that runs smoothly. Whether you’re a beginner trying to fix basic issues or an advanced user looking for comprehensive solutions, this guide will walk you through five essential Windows features for managing system file repair—plus bonus advice on using third-party solutions like Glary Utilities for deeper cleanup and repair.

Why System File Repair Matters

System files are the backbone of the Windows operating system. When these files become corrupted or go missing, programs can malfunction, updates may fail, or the system might refuse to start. Repairing these files ensures that Windows can function as intended and prevents small problems from turning into major headaches.

1\. System File Checker (sfc /scannow)

Beginner Guide: System File Checker is a straightforward command-line tool built into Windows that scans and repairs corrupted or missing system files.

How to Use It: - Press the Windows key, type “cmd”, right-click Command Prompt, and select “Run as administrator.” - In the Command Prompt window, type: sfc /scannow - Press Enter and let the process complete (it may take several minutes). - If issues are found, SFC will attempt to repair them automatically. Restart your computer when done.

Example: If your computer is displaying frequent error messages or system programs are crashing, running sfc /scannow can often resolve these by restoring original versions of problem files.

Advanced Tip: If SFC cannot fix an issue, it will display a message. Check the CBS.log file (located in C:\\Windows\\Logs\\CBS\\CBS.log) for details on the files it could not repair.

2\. Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM)

Beginner Guide: DISM is a more advanced tool that can repair the Windows image, which is sometimes necessary if SFC fails to fix certain problems.

How to Use It: - Open Command Prompt as administrator. - Type: DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth - Press Enter. Allow the process to complete, which might take 10-30 minutes. - After DISM completes, it’s a good idea to run sfc /scannow again to ensure all issues are resolved.

Example: If you receive messages such as “Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them” after running SFC, use DISM as the next step.

Advanced Tip: DISM can also use a different Windows image as a source for repairs. This is useful for advanced users handling persistent or complex cases.

3\. Windows Troubleshooters

Beginner Guide: Windows includes automatic troubleshooters for common issues like Windows Update failures, network problems, and blue screen errors.

How to Use It: - Open Settings (Windows key + I). - Go to Update & Security > Troubleshoot. - Select the relevant troubleshooter (e.g., Windows Update) and run it. - Follow the on-screen instructions.

Example: If Windows Update is stuck or failing, run the Windows Update troubleshooter to automatically detect and repair issues.

Advanced Tip: Some troubleshooters are only available from the Microsoft Support website. Advanced users can download and run these for more specialized problems.

4\. System Restore

Beginner Guide: System Restore allows you to revert your PC to a previous working state without affecting personal files.

How to Use It: - Press the Windows key, type “Create a restore point,” and select it. - Under System Protection, click “System Restore.” - Follow the prompts to choose a restore point (usually created automatically before updates or installations). - Confirm and let the process complete.

Example: If your computer began malfunctioning after a recent software installation or driver update, System Restore can quickly undo the changes.

Advanced Tip: If Windows won’t start, boot into Safe Mode and run System Restore from there for more reliable recovery.

5\. Startup Repair

Beginner Guide: Startup Repair is a Windows Recovery Environment tool that fixes boot-related issues preventing Windows from starting.

How to Use It: - Restart your PC and hold down Shift while clicking “Restart” from the login screen or Start menu. - Select Troubleshoot > Advanced options > Startup Repair. - Follow the instructions to let Windows automatically diagnose and repair startup problems.

Example: If your PC won’t boot and keeps looping on the loading screen, Startup Repair can often get you back into Windows without needing to reinstall.

Advanced Tip: If Startup Repair fails, advanced users may explore Command Prompt from the Recovery Environment to run bootrec commands for deeper fixes.
