Windows comes with a suite of built-in system information tools that help users monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize their PCs. Keeping these tools functioning efficiently is crucial for diagnosing problems and maintaining overall system health. This article provides ten proven methods to maintain Windows system information tools, ensuring they deliver accurate and timely information. Whether you’re just starting or already have technical experience, you’ll find valuable step-by-step advice for every skill level.

Why Maintain System Information Tools?

System information tools like System Information (msinfo32), Task Manager, Resource Monitor, and Device Manager are essential for understanding your PC’s hardware and performance. Poor maintenance can lead to inaccurate readings, slow diagnostics, or even tool failures. A well-maintained system ensures these utilities work seamlessly when you need them most.

Method 1: Keep Windows Updated

For Beginners: 1. Click the Start menu and select Settings. 2. Choose Update & Security. 3. Click Windows Update, then select Check for updates. 4. Install any available updates and restart your PC if required.

Why it matters: Updates often fix bugs and improve compatibility with system tools.

For Advanced Users: - Use PowerShell with the command: Get-WindowsUpdate to review pending updates and Install-WindowsUpdate to apply them.

Method 2: Clean Up System Junk Regularly

For Beginners: 1. Open Settings and go to System > Storage. 2. Turn on Storage Sense to automate cleanup. 3. Manually click “Temporary files” and select items to remove.

For Advanced Users: - Use the built-in Disk Cleanup tool (cleanmgr), or - Automate with scripts using PowerShell’s Clear-RecycleBin or Remove-Item cmdlets.

Recommended Tool: Glary Utilities offers an advanced “Disk Cleaner” and “Tracks Eraser” that efficiently remove unwanted files, helping system tools access up-to-date information for diagnosis.

Method 3: Verify Integrity of System Files

For Beginners: 1. Search for Command Prompt, right-click it, and select Run as administrator. 2. Type sfc /scannow and press Enter. 3. Wait for the scan to complete and follow on-screen instructions.

For Advanced Users: - Use DISM with the command: DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth for deeper repairs.

Real-World Example: If Task Manager shows missing data, a corrupt system file may be the cause.

Method 4: Regularly Update Device Drivers

For Beginners: 1. Press Windows key + X and select Device Manager. 2. Right-click a device and choose Update driver. 3. Follow prompts to search automatically for updates.

For Advanced Users: - Download drivers directly from the manufacturer’s website for the most recent releases. - Use PowerShell: Get-WmiObject Win32\_PnPSignedDriver for detailed driver information.

Glary Utilities Feature: The “Driver Manager” helps keep track of outdated drivers and safely updates them, reducing hardware information mismatches.

Method 5: Monitor Background Processes

For Beginners: 1. Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager. 2. Click the Processes tab to view running applications and background processes. 3. End unnecessary tasks by right-clicking and selecting End task.

For Advanced Users: - Analyze processes with Resource Monitor (type resmon in Start). - Use command-line tools like tasklist or PowerShell scripts for automated monitoring.

Method 6: Configure System Restore Points

For Beginners: 1. Open Control Panel and search for System Restore. 2. Click Create a restore point, then click Create. 3. Name the restore point and confirm.

For Advanced Users: - Use PowerShell: Checkpoint-Computer -Description "Pre-update Restore Point"

This ensures you can revert to a working state if a tool or update causes problems.

Method 7: Regularly Defragment Hard Drives

For Beginners: 1. Open the Start menu, search for Defragment and Optimize Drives. 2. Select your drive and click Optimize.

For Advanced Users: - Use defrag C: /O in Command Prompt for advanced optimization options.

Note: SSDs do not require traditional defragmentation.

Glary Utilities Feature: The “Disk Defrag” module provides a user-friendly interface and scheduling options for regular optimization.

Method 8: Audit Startup Programs

For Beginners: 1. Open Task Manager and go to the Startup tab. 2. Disable unwanted programs by right-clicking and selecting Disable.

For Advanced Users: - Use msconfig from Run dialog for detailed configuration. - Use Autoruns from Microsoft Sysinternals for comprehensive control.

Glary Utilities Feature: The “Startup Manager” makes it easy to view, enable, or disable startup items with more detailed descriptions than Windows alone provides.

Method 9: Back Up Important System Settings

For Beginners: 1. Use the built-in Backup & Restore in Control Panel to create backups of your system settings.

For Advanced Users: - Use wbadmin or PowerShell scripts for scheduled backups. - Export system information using msinfo32 /report to save configuration snapshots.

Method 10: Utilize Third-Party Optimization Tools

For All Users: - Regular maintenance with a trusted suite like Glary Utilities can centralize tasks such as junk removal, registry cleaning, driver updates, and more. - Schedule regular scans to ensure all aspects of system tools remain optimized and functional.

Practical Example: Running the “1-Click Maintenance” in Glary Utilities automatically cleans junk files, repairs registry issues, manages startup items, and can even schedule regular maintenance, freeing up time and reducing the risk of something being missed.
