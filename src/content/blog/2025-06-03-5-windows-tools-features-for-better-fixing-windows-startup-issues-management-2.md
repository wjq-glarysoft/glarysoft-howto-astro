Windows startup issues can be frustrating, causing slow boot times, error messages, or even preventing your PC from loading at all. Many users attempt quick fixes or make common mistakes that can worsen the situation. To help you efficiently manage and repair startup problems, let’s explore five essential Windows tools and features you should use—along with common errors to avoid and actionable steps for both beginners and advanced users.

Why Are Startup Issues So Common?

Startup problems often occur due to accumulated junk files, corrupted system files, overly aggressive software installations, or malware. Attempting random fixes or ignoring error messages can lead to bigger problems. Using the right Windows built-in tools and trusted utilities like Glary Utilities can make the repair process straightforward and safe.

Beginner Section: Easy Fixes and Common Pitfalls

1\. Task Manager: Managing Startup Programs

Mistake to Avoid: Disabling critical system services or ignoring unrecognized entries.

How to Use It: - Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager. - Click the Startup tab to see all programs launching at boot. - Review each entry. Right-click and choose ‘Disable’ for non-essential programs (like auto-updaters for games or software you rarely use). - Leave antivirus, sound, and display services enabled.

Tip: Unsure about an entry? Search its name online or use Glary Utilities’ Startup Manager for extra guidance and safe recommendations.

2\. Windows Settings: The Recovery Menu

Mistake to Avoid: Performing a full reset or restore without backup, risking data loss.

How to Use It: - Go to Settings > Update & Security > Recovery. - Use the options to restart your PC for troubleshooting or to access advanced startup. - Always select 'Keep my files' if you need to perform a reset, unless you have thoroughly backed up your data.

Practical Example: If your PC fails to boot, use ‘Startup Repair’ under Advanced Startup to let Windows fix common issues automatically.

Intermediate to Advanced Section: Deeper Diagnostics and Cleaning

3\. System File Checker (SFC) and DISM

Mistake to Avoid: Skipping these tools and immediately reinstalling Windows.

How to Use SFC: - Open Command Prompt as Administrator. - Type sfc /scannow and press Enter. - Wait for completion; Windows will attempt to repair corrupted system files.

How to Use DISM: - In Command Prompt, type dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth and press Enter. - This checks and repairs deeper system issues, often fixing problems SFC cannot.

Tip: Run SFC first, then DISM if issues persist.

4\. Safe Mode: A Clean Startup for Troubleshooting

Mistake to Avoid: Making system changes while in normal mode with background apps interfering.

How to Boot in Safe Mode: - Restart your PC and press F8 (on some systems, hold Shift and click Restart in Windows). - Choose ‘Safe Mode’ or ‘Safe Mode with Networking’ for internet access. - Use this mode to uninstall problematic drivers or recently added software.

Real-World Example: If your PC boots in Safe Mode but not normally, a recent driver or startup program is likely at fault.

5\. Glary Utilities: Comprehensive Startup and Registry Repair

Mistake to Avoid: Manually editing the registry or deleting files from system folders without expert knowledge.

Why Use [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com)? - Its 1-Click Maintenance can safely clean up junk files, fix registry errors, and optimize startup items without risking system stability. - The Startup Manager gives detailed information about each program, making it easy to disable or delay non-essential launches. - The Registry Repair tool scans for and fixes invalid registry entries that can cause boot problems.

How to Use Glary Utilities for Startup Issues: - Download and install Glary Utilities. - Run the 1-Click Maintenance for a quick overall cleanup. - Go to Advanced Tools > Startup Manager to review and manage startup programs. - Use Registry Repair for a thorough scan and safe cleaning of registry errors impacting startup.

Bonus Tip for Advanced Users: Use Event Viewer to diagnose the exact cause of startup delays or errors (run eventvwr.msc and check under Windows Logs > System for critical errors during boot).
