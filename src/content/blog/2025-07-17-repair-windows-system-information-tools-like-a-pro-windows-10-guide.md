Understanding System Information Tools in Windows 10

Windows 10 includes several built-in tools that provide detailed information about your computer’s hardware, software, and system configuration. Knowing how to access, interpret, and repair these tools is essential for troubleshooting, optimizing performance, and ensuring your system runs smoothly. As an intermediate Windows user, you can go beyond the basics and leverage these tools like a pro with a few practical steps.

Why Are System Information Tools Important?

System information tools help you: - Identify hardware details (CPU, RAM, storage) - Check for driver or hardware issues - Monitor system performance - Troubleshoot problems and plan upgrades

Common Windows System Information Tools

1\. System Information (msinfo32) 2. Device Manager 3. Task Manager 4. Resource Monitor 5. Performance Monitor

How to Access and Use System Information (msinfo32)

To open System Information: 1. Press Windows + R to open the Run dialog. 2. Type msinfo32 and press Enter.

This tool gives you an organized view of your system summary, hardware resources, components, and software environment.

What to Do if System Information Doesn't Work?

Sometimes, msinfo32 may not open or might show incomplete data. Here’s how to repair it: - Run System File Checker (SFC) 1. Open Command Prompt as Administrator (right-click Start > Command Prompt (Admin)) 2. Type sfc /scannow and press Enter. 3. Wait for the process to complete; it will repair missing or corrupted system files. - Check Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) Service 1. Press Windows + R, type services.msc, and press Enter. 2. Scroll down to Windows Management Instrumentation, right-click, and select Restart.

Fixing Device Manager Issues

Device Manager is crucial for viewing and updating drivers. If Device Manager fails to load: - Restart your PC. - Try accessing it using Windows + X, then select Device Manager. - If devices have a yellow triangle, right-click and choose Update driver. - To fix persistent driver issues, uninstall the device and restart your computer—Windows will attempt to reinstall the driver.

Optimizing with Task Manager and Resource Monitor

Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc) and Resource Monitor allow you to see how resources are being used. If Task Manager is unresponsive: - Press Ctrl + Alt + Del and select Task Manager. - Run a malware scan if Task Manager closes immediately—malware can disable it. - If it’s still not working, open Command Prompt as Administrator and run: DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth

If you prefer a visual interface, Glary Utilities’ performance monitoring tools can show real-time resource usage and historical trends, making it easier to spot issues.

When Should You Use System Restore?

If a system tool is consistently malfunctioning and repairs are unsuccessful, use System Restore to revert your PC to an earlier state: 1. Search for 'Create a restore point' in the Start menu. 2. Click 'System Restore' and follow the prompts to select a restore point from before the issue began.
