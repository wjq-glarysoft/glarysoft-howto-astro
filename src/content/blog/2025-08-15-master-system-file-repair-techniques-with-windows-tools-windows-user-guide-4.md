Keeping your Windows system healthy is essential for smooth performance, and damaged or missing system files can cause crashes, slowdowns, and unexpected errors. Fortunately, Windows includes built-in tools designed to detect and repair these files. As a beginner, understanding how to use these tools effectively will help you maintain your computer and prevent small issues from becoming big problems.

What are system files and why do they matter?

System files are the core files that make Windows run. They include everything from the processes that start your computer to the files that control the look of your desktop. When these files are damaged, you may experience freezing, application errors, or even the inability to start Windows at all. Causes for corruption can include sudden shutdowns, malware infections, or incomplete software installations.

How can you check and repair system files with System File Checker?

System File Checker, or SFC, is a built-in Windows utility that scans and repairs corrupted system files. It’s straightforward enough for beginners to use without risk of damaging anything.

Step-by-step example:

1\. Click the Start menu and type “cmd” in the search box. 2. Right-click Command Prompt and select “Run as administrator.” 3. In the black window that appears, type the command: sfc /scannow and press Enter. 4. Wait while Windows scans your system. This process can take several minutes. 5. When the scan finishes, Windows will display a summary. If problems were found and fixed, you may be asked to restart your computer.

This tool automatically replaces damaged files with a cached copy stored on your computer. It’s one of the safest and most effective first steps in system repair.

When should you use the Deployment Imaging and Servicing Management tool?

If SFC cannot repair some files, the Deployment Imaging and Servicing Management (DISM) tool comes into play. DISM fixes issues in the Windows system image itself, which SFC depends on to replace files.

Step-by-step example:

1\. Open Command Prompt as an administrator. 2. Type the command: DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth and press Enter. 3. Wait for the process to complete; this can take longer than SFC. 4. Once finished, run sfc /scannow again to confirm that all corrupted files are repaired.

DISM ensures that the source files SFC relies on are healthy, making it a powerful follow-up when SFC alone doesn’t resolve problems.

Can third-party tools help in keeping system files healthy?

While SFC and DISM are excellent for repairing existing issues, regular maintenance can prevent problems from arising. Glary Utilities is a comprehensive tool that goes beyond simple file repairs. It offers features such as registry cleaning, junk file removal, startup program management, and disk error checking, all of which can reduce the risk of system file corruption.

For example, using [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) to remove leftover files from uninstalled programs can prevent conflicts that sometimes lead to system errors. Its one-click maintenance mode simplifies cleanup, making it beginner-friendly while covering multiple aspects of system health in a single run.

What is the best approach for beginners to repair and maintain Windows files?

A structured approach works best. Begin with prevention by regularly cleaning your system using a tool like [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com). If you encounter problems, start with SFC for a quick scan and repair. If that fails, move on to DISM to restore the health of your Windows image, then re-run SFC to complete the repair process.

By combining Windows’ built-in repair tools with regular maintenance using Glary Utilities, even beginners can effectively keep their system files in top condition and avoid many common Windows errors. This combination ensures a faster, more stable PC without the need for complex technical skills.
