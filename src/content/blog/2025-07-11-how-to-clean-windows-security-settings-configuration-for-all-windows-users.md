Windows Security settings play a crucial role in protecting your PC from threats, safeguarding personal data, and ensuring smooth operation. Over time, these settings can become cluttered or misconfigured due to software changes, user modifications, or system updates. Cleaning up your Windows security settings is essential for both privacy and system performance. This article explains, step-by-step, how to review, reset, and optimize Windows security configurations for all users, with tailored instructions for both beginners and advanced users.

Why Clean Windows Security Settings?

Security settings directly impact the protection of your files, user data, and network safety. Misconfigured or outdated settings can expose your system to risks, cause unnecessary prompts, or reduce usability. Cleaning these settings ensures that the PC runs efficiently while maintaining strong security.

Section 1: For Beginners – Basic Windows Security Cleanup

What are the recommended steps to review and reset basic Windows security settings?

1\. Check and Reset Windows Defender Settings

\- Go to Start > Settings > Privacy & Security > Windows Security. - Open "Virus & threat protection" and click "Manage settings." - Make sure Real-time protection, Cloud-delivered protection, and Automatic sample submission are all enabled. - If you suspect settings have been tampered with, scroll down and click "Restore settings to their default values."

2\. Review and Clean Up Account Permissions

\- Open Settings > Accounts > Family & Other Users. - Remove any unknown or unnecessary accounts. - Ensure your main account is set as a Standard or Administrator account as appropriate.

3\. Clean Unused or Risky Apps

\- Go to Settings > Apps > Installed apps. - Uninstall any suspicious or unused programs, especially those you do not recognize.

4\. Use Glary Utilities for Automated Privacy Cleanup

1\. Reset Group Policy Settings

Group Policy changes can create hidden vulnerabilities.

\- Open Command Prompt as Administrator. - Enter: RD /S /Q "%windir%\\System32\\GroupPolicy" RD /S /Q "%windir%\\System32\\GroupPolicyUsers" - Reboot the PC. This will remove all custom Group Policy settings, restoring them to default.

2\. Clean Security Policies and Audit Settings

3\. Remove Old Credentials and Certificates

\- Open Control Panel > User Accounts > Credential Manager. - Remove any stored credentials that are unused or suspicious. - For certificates, go to Run > certmgr.msc, and review certificates under "Personal" and "Trusted Root Certification Authorities." Remove any you do not recognize.

4\. Review Windows Firewall Rules

\- Go to Control Panel > System and Security > Windows Defender Firewall > Advanced settings. - In "Inbound Rules" and "Outbound Rules," disable or delete any rules for applications you no longer use, or that appear suspicious.

5\. Harden PowerShell and Script Execution Policies

\- Open PowerShell as Administrator. - Run: Get-ExecutionPolicy (to check current policy) - To reset: Set-ExecutionPolicy Default

6\. Use Glary Utilities Advanced Tools

Glary Utilities offers advanced privacy tools for experienced users:

\- Launch [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com), navigate to the "Privacy & Security" tab. - Use the "Tracks Eraser" to remove traces of system and internet activity. - Access "File Shredder" to securely delete sensitive files. - Schedule regular scans to maintain a clean privacy profile.
