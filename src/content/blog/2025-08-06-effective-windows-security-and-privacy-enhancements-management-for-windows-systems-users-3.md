Managing the security and privacy of a Windows system is a critical task for advanced users who demand both protection and performance. This guide offers step-by-step instructions to help you enhance your Windows security posture and ensure your privacy is maintained, using built-in tools, best practices, and specialized utilities such as Glary Utilities.

How Can You Harden Windows Security Through System Settings?

1\. Set Up Strong Local and Network Account Policies - Open the Local Security Policy panel (secpol.msc). - Navigate to Account Policies > Password Policy. - Set minimum password length (recommend at least 12 characters). - Enable “Password must meet complexity requirements.” - Adjust account lockout policies to deter brute-force attacks.

2\. Configure User Account Control (UAC) - Open Control Panel > User Accounts > Change User Account Control settings. - Set UAC to “Always notify” for maximum protection, especially on machines with multiple users or exposed to public networks.

3\. Audit and Manage Windows Firewall Rules - Open Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security (wf.msc). - Review inbound and outbound rules. - Remove or disable rules for apps you no longer use. - Create custom rules for sensitive ports (RDP, SMB) and restrict them to trusted IP addresses only.

4\. Enable BitLocker Drive Encryption - Open Control Panel > System and Security > BitLocker Drive Encryption. - Turn on BitLocker for your system and data drives. - Use a strong, unique recovery key and store it securely offline.

Which Privacy Settings Should Advanced Users Tweak?

1\. Adjust Telemetry and Data Collection - Go to Settings > Privacy & security > Diagnostics & feedback. - Set Diagnostic data to “Required only.” - Disable “Tailored experiences” and “Send optional diagnostic data.”

2\. Manage App Permissions - In Settings > Privacy & security, review permissions for Location, Camera, Microphone, Contacts, etc. - Disable access for non-essential apps, especially those not from trusted vendors.

3\. Limit Cortana and Online Speech Recognition - Open Settings > Privacy & security > Speech. - Turn off “Online speech recognition.” - Disable Cortana from accessing personal data via Settings > Apps > Cortana > Permissions & History.

4\. Review Activity History - In Settings > Privacy & security > Activity history, uncheck options to send activity history to Microsoft. - Clear activity history from your device.

How Do You Secure Windows Networking and Remote Access?

1\. Disable Unused Network Protocols and Services - Open Network and Sharing Center > Change adapter settings > Right-click your adapter > Properties. - Uncheck protocols like File and Printer Sharing, IPv6, or Client for Microsoft Networks if not needed.

2\. Restrict RDP Access - In System Properties > Remote, disable Remote Desktop if not required. - If enabled, use Network Level Authentication (NLA) and limit access to specific users. - Consider setting up a VPN and firewall rules to restrict RDP to internal IP ranges only.

3\. Enable SMB Signing and Disable SMBv1 - Open Windows Features and uncheck “SMB 1.0/CIFS File Sharing Support.” - Enforce SMB signing via Group Policy for secure network file transfers.
