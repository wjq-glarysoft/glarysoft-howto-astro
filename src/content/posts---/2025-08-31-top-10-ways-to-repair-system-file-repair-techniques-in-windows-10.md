System file issues in Windows 10 can cause slow performance, crashes, or even prevent your PC from booting correctly. For intermediate Windows users, knowing how to repair these files is essential for keeping your system stable and running smoothly. Below are ten practical techniques that focus on Clean Up & Repair, combined with real-world examples and step-by-step instructions.

1\. Running System File Checker (SFC) The System File Checker tool scans for missing or corrupt Windows files and automatically replaces them with the correct versions. To use it, open Command Prompt as Administrator, then type: sfc /scannow This process may take a while, but it is the first line of defense when dealing with damaged or altered system files. Many users find that this simple step resolves frequent crashes or errors after software installations.

2\. Using DISM Command for Image Repairs If SFC cannot fix the files, Deployment Imaging and Servicing Management (DISM) can repair the underlying Windows image. Launch Command Prompt as Administrator and run: DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth This tool is particularly useful when Windows updates fail or when system restore points no longer work. By repairing the system image, DISM makes SFC more effective on the next run.

3\. Checking Disk Health with CHKDSK Corrupt files sometimes result from hard drive errors. CHKDSK helps detect and fix bad sectors. In Command Prompt, type: chkdsk C: /f /r This will check your C: drive, fix errors, and recover readable data. It’s a critical step if you experience repeated system crashes or disk-related slowdowns.

4\. Running Windows Startup Repair If your PC fails to boot, Startup Repair can automatically detect and resolve issues stopping Windows from loading. Restart your computer, hold Shift, and select Restart. Then navigate to Troubleshoot > Advanced options > Startup Repair. This method can solve boot loops or black screen problems caused by faulty system files.

5\. Restoring Windows with System Restore System Restore rolls back your entire system to an earlier point before problems occurred. Type "System Restore" in the Start menu, open it, and choose a restore point when your PC was stable. This is particularly useful when system file corruption occurs after installing new drivers or updates.

6\. Reverting Windows Updates Sometimes, faulty updates cause system file corruption. You can uninstall recent updates by going to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update > View update history > Uninstall updates. Removing a problematic update often restores stability without requiring deeper repairs.

7\. Using Safe Mode for Repairs Safe Mode loads Windows with minimal drivers and services, making it easier to troubleshoot file issues. Access it by pressing Shift + Restart, then navigating to Troubleshoot > Advanced options > Startup Settings > Restart > Select 4 (Safe Mode). From here, you can run SFC, DISM, or uninstall problematic software safely.

8\. Performing a Clean Boot Conflicts with third-party applications sometimes mimic system file corruption. A Clean Boot starts Windows with only essential services. Press Windows + R, type msconfig, go to the Services tab, check "Hide all Microsoft services," and then disable the rest. Restart your computer and test to see if the problem persists. This helps isolate whether the issue is related to system files or conflicting programs.

9\. Using [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) for Cleanup and File Repair [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) is an all-in-one tool that simplifies system maintenance. For system file repair, it offers features like Registry Cleaner, Disk Repair, and File System Error Fixer. For example, after running SFC and DISM, you can use Glary Utilities’ 1-Click Maintenance to scan for leftover issues like broken shortcuts, invalid registry entries, or disk errors. This ensures your system remains optimized, reducing the chances of repeated corruption. Intermediate users benefit from its easy interface that combines multiple repair tools into one platform.

10\. Resetting Windows 10 While Keeping Files If all else fails, a Windows reset reinstalls system files while allowing you to keep personal files. Go to Settings > Update & Security > Recovery > Reset this PC > Keep my files. This process refreshes the operating system to a clean state, replacing all corrupted files, but without the data loss that comes with a full reinstall.

System file repair in Windows 10 requires a mix of built-in tools and careful cleanup practices. Using methods such as SFC, DISM, CHKDSK, and tools like [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) ensures both quick fixes and long-term stability. By following these techniques, you can maintain a healthier, faster, and more reliable Windows environment.
