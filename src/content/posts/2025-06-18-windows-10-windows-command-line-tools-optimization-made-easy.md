Windows 10 offers a variety of powerful command line tools that can significantly enhance system performance, automate routine maintenance, and help troubleshoot issues. Many users overlook these tools, but with a bit of guidance, both beginners and advanced users can take full advantage of what Windows has to offer. This article provides expert recommendations, practical tips, and real-world examples to make Windows command line tools work for you.

Why Use Command Line Tools for System Optimization?

Command line tools provide a direct and efficient way to interact with your operating system. Unlike graphical utilities, these tools often grant more control, faster results, and greater flexibility—especially when it comes to batch processing or scripting routine tasks. Command line tools can be especially valuable for optimizing and maintaining your system, whether you’re freeing up disk space, checking system health, or managing startup processes.

Where to Start: Accessing the Command Line

For all command line tasks, you’ll use either Command Prompt or Windows PowerShell. To open Command Prompt, press Windows + R, type cmd, and hit Enter. For PowerShell, type powershell instead.

How Can I Clean Temporary Files Using the Command Line?

A cluttered hard drive can seriously slow down your PC. Windows provides a built-in tool called Disk Cleanup, but you can automate this with command line instructions.

To quickly delete temporary files:

1\. Open Command Prompt as Administrator. 2. Type the following command and press Enter: del /q/f/s %TEMP%\\\* 3. This command forcefully removes all files from your temporary folder, instantly freeing up space.

How Do I Check Disk Health Using the Command Line?

A healthy disk is essential for system performance. The Check Disk utility can be run directly from the command line:

1\. Open Command Prompt as Administrator. 2. Type: chkdsk C: /f /r 3. Press Y if prompted to schedule at next restart, then reboot your PC. This will scan and repair file system errors and locate bad sectors.

How Can I Manage Startup Programs Using the Command Line?

Too many startup programs can slow your PC’s boot time. To view and adjust startups:

1\. Open PowerShell as Administrator. 2. Type: Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32\_StartupCommand | Select-Object Name, Command, Location, User 3. Review the list. Disable unwanted programs via Task Manager for a graphical approach, or use Autoruns (a Sysinternals tool) for more control.

How Do I Automate System Cleanup Tasks?

Advanced users can automate routine maintenance by combining multiple commands in a batch file or PowerShell script. For example, create a script that:

\- Cleans temp files - Clears DNS cache - Deletes old Windows update files

Example batch script (save as cleanup.bat):

del /q/f/s %TEMP%\\\* ipconfig /flushdns cleanmgr /sagerun:1

To configure Cleanmgr for sagerun, first run: cleanmgr /sageset:1 Select the categories you want to clean, then run the script regularly.

How Can I Monitor Resource Usage from the Command Line?

Windows offers several tools for monitoring system performance:

\- Tasklist: Lists all running processes. tasklist

\- Taskkill: Kills a specific process. taskkill /IM notepad.exe /F

\- Systeminfo: Displays detailed system configuration including uptime and installed updates. systeminfo

How Do I Find and Remove Large Files with the Command Line?

If your drive is filling up, use the following command to find all files over 100MB on your C: drive:

forfiles /P C:\\ /S /M \*.\* /C "cmd /c if @fsize GTR 104857600 echo @path @fsize"

This will list large files, helping you identify space hogs.
