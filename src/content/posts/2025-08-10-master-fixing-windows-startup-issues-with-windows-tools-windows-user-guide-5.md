Are you struggling to get your Windows PC to start properly? Startup problems are frustrating, but Windows offers built-in tools and methods for troubleshooting and repair. This guide walks you through practical, step-by-step solutions to fix the most common Windows startup issues, suitable for both beginners and more advanced users. We’ll also highlight how third-party tools like Glary Utilities can further streamline the process of cleaning up and maintaining your system after you get back up and running.

What Are Common Windows Startup Problems?

Startup problems can range from a black screen, endless loading, error messages, or Windows not booting at all. The root causes may include corrupted system files, bad updates, hardware changes, or leftover junk files from previous installations. Fortunately, Windows provides several built-in tools to resolve these issues.

How to Use Windows Startup Repair

Startup Repair is a dedicated tool for fixing problems that prevent Windows from loading.

1\. Access Startup Repair: - If Windows fails to boot several times, the Automatic Repair screen should appear. If not, use a Windows installation media (USB/DVD) to boot your PC. - Select your language and region, then click "Repair your computer" instead of "Install."

2\. Navigate to Troubleshoot > Advanced options > Startup Repair.

3\. Choose your operating system, then wait as Windows scans and attempts to fix startup problems.

Example: If you receive errors like "Your PC did not start correctly," Startup Repair can resolve issues such as missing or damaged system files.

How to Use System Restore to Undo Problematic Changes

System Restore allows you to roll back your system files and settings to a previous working state without affecting personal files.

1\. Enter Advanced Startup Options: - Restart your PC while holding the Shift key or boot from installation media and select "Repair your computer." - Go to Troubleshoot > Advanced options > System Restore.

2\. Select a restore point dated before your startup problems began. Follow the prompts to restore.

Example: If your PC started failing to boot after a recent driver update or software installation, System Restore can revert those changes.

How to Repair Corrupted System Files with SFC and DISM

Corrupted or missing system files can cause startup failures. Windows includes command-line tools to fix these issues.

1\. Open Command Prompt from Advanced Startup: - In Advanced options, select "Command Prompt."

2\. Run System File Checker (SFC): - Type: sfc /scannow - Press Enter. Wait until the scan completes and follow any repair prompts.

3\. If SFC fails, run Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM): - Type: dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth - Press Enter and let the process finish.

Example: If your PC displays “Windows failed to start. A recent hardware or software change might be the cause,” SFC and DISM can restore essential system files.

How to Clean Up Startup Programs and Junk Files

Unnecessary startup programs and leftover junk can sometimes cause slow or problematic boot-ups. After repairing your system, it’s wise to tidy up.

Using [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) for Clean Up & Repair:

Glary Utilities helps remove broken shortcuts, fix registry errors, and manage startup programs for quicker, smoother boot times.

How to Use Safe Mode for Troubleshooting

Safe Mode loads Windows with minimal drivers and services, making it easier to identify and fix issues.

1\. Enter Safe Mode: - From Advanced Startup, go to Troubleshoot > Advanced options > Startup Settings, then click Restart. - After restart, choose "4" or "F4" for Safe Mode.

2\. Once in Safe Mode, uninstall problematic software, update drivers, or use [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) to run clean-up tasks safely.

When Should You Seek Additional Help?

If Windows still won’t start after these steps, consider: - Checking hardware connections (RAM, hard drive, cables) - Running a memory test (in Advanced options) - Consulting professional repair services if hardware failure is suspected
