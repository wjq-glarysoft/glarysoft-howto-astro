Windows 11 brings a host of new networking features and enhancements, but even out of the box, your network performance may not be fully optimized. Whether you're a home user wanting smoother streaming and gaming, or an advanced user managing file transfers and remote desktop sessions, fine-tuning your network settings can deliver real-world improvements. Below are the seven most effective strategies for optimizing and improving network performance on Windows 11, with step-by-step instructions and practical examples.

Why Should You Tune Network Performance?

Optimizing your network can: - Reduce latency for online gaming and video calls - Boost download and upload speeds - Minimize buffering during streaming - Improve reliability for remote work and cloud access

Beginner Strategies for Quick Network Improvements

1\. Update Network Drivers for Maximum Compatibility

Outdated or generic network drivers can throttle your network speed and cause intermittent issues.

How to Update: - Right-click the Start button and select Device Manager. - Expand the “Network adapters” section. - Right-click your network adapter and choose “Update driver”. - Select “Search automatically for drivers”. Windows will search and install the latest driver. For best results, visit your network adapter manufacturer’s website for the newest release.

2\. Use Windows Network Troubleshooter

Windows 11 includes a built-in troubleshooter that can automatically detect and resolve many common network issues.

How to Run: - Go to Settings > System > Troubleshoot > Other troubleshooters. - Find “Network Adapter” and click “Run”. Follow the prompts to identify and fix issues.

3\. Clean Up Network-Related Junk and Optimize with Glary Utilities

Temporary files, outdated DNS caches, and unnecessary startup items can hinder network performance.

Using [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com): - Download and install Glary Utilities from the official website. - Open the program and select “1-Click Maintenance”. - Ensure “Network Optimization” and “Temporary Files Cleaner” are checked. - Click “Scan for Issues” and then “Repair Problems”. This will remove junk that can slow your network and optimize key settings for smoother connectivity.

Advanced Strategies for Enthusiasts and Power Users

4\. Tweak Receive Side Scaling (RSS) and Large Send Offload

Receive Side Scaling and Large Send Offload are advanced network adapter features that can improve throughput on multi-core CPUs.

How to Adjust: - Go to Device Manager > Network adapters. - Right-click your adapter, select Properties > Advanced tab. - Look for “Receive Side Scaling” and set it to “Enabled”. - Find “Large Send Offload” (IPv4/IPv6) and set them to “Enabled” or “On”. Apply changes and restart your computer.

5\. Optimize TCP/IP Settings for High-Performance Connections

The default Windows settings may not suit fast fiber or gigabit connections. You can fine-tune these with Windows’ built-in tools.

Example: - Open Command Prompt as Administrator. - Run: netsh int tcp set global autotuninglevel=normal netsh int tcp set global rss=enabled Test your speed after applying these changes.

6\. Disable Background Apps and Services Consuming Bandwidth

Many background apps and Windows services can silently use your bandwidth.

How to Control: - Open Settings > Apps > Startup. - Disable unnecessary apps from launching at startup. - In Settings > Privacy & security > Background apps, turn off apps you don’t need running in the background. Additionally, use Glary Utilities’ “Startup Manager” to quickly identify and disable bandwidth-hogging programs.

7\. Prioritize Network Traffic with Quality of Service (QoS)

If your router and network adapter support QoS, you can prioritize important traffic (gaming, video calls) over less critical data.

How to Set Up: - Log in to your router’s web interface (refer to your router manual). - Find QoS settings and enable them. - Assign higher priority to your Windows 11 device or to specific services (e.g., Zoom, Teams, Steam).

Bonus: Regular Maintenance with Glary Utilities

For consistent peak network performance, schedule regular maintenance using [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com): - Open Glary Utilities and set up a weekly “1-Click Maintenance” task. - Use the “Tracks Eraser” to clear browser caches and cookies that may interfere with loading websites.

Conclusion

By systematically following these seven strategies, you can significantly optimize and improve your Windows 11 network performance. Beginners will benefit from updating drivers, using built-in troubleshooters, and leveraging [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) for easy cleanup. Advanced users can dive into adapter settings, TCP/IP tweaks, and QoS controls for granular enhancements. With regular maintenance and optimization, your Windows 11 PC will enjoy faster, more reliable network connectivity for all your online activities.
