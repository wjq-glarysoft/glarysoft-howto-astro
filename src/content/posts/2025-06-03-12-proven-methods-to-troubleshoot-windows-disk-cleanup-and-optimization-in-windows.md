Keeping your Windows system running smoothly requires regular disk cleanup and optimization. Over time, junk files, fragmented data, and software issues can accumulate, slowing performance and reducing available disk space. Even Windows’ built-in tools can sometimes misbehave or yield less-than-optimal results. As a Windows system expert, I’ll guide you through 12 proven methods—ranging from basic to advanced—to troubleshoot and master Windows disk cleanup and optimization.

For All Users: Essential Disk Cleanup and Optimization

1\. Use Windows Disk Cleanup Utility Correctly The built-in Disk Cleanup tool is a solid starting point. Access it by typing “Disk Cleanup” in the Start menu search box. Select your system drive (usually C:), and let it scan for files to delete. Review each checkbox carefully (Temporary files, Recycle Bin, etc.), and click OK to remove them. If you want to clean up system files, click “Clean up system files.”

Tip: If Disk Cleanup won’t start or gets stuck, reboot your PC and try again. If issues persist, see the advanced troubleshooting steps below.

2\. Empty the Recycle Bin Regularly Many users forget that deleted files reside in the Recycle Bin, still occupying valuable disk space. Right-click the Recycle Bin icon on your desktop, choose “Empty Recycle Bin,” and confirm.

3\. Uninstall Unused Programs Unneeded applications take up both space and resources. Go to Settings > Apps > Installed apps (or Control Panel > Programs and Features), sort by size or installation date, and remove anything you no longer use. This simple step can recover gigabytes of space.

4\. Delete Temporary and Cache Files Manually Temporary files can accumulate quickly. Press Windows + R, type %temp%, and press Enter. Delete everything inside the folder. Repeat with temp (without the % signs) and prefetch folders to clear more cache.

5\. Use Glary Utilities for Comprehensive Cleanup and Repair For a truly thorough cleanup, Glary Utilities offers a user-friendly interface and deep-cleaning features beyond the native tools. Its “1-Click Maintenance” function scans for junk files, invalid registry entries, broken shortcuts, and more. For beginners, this is the simplest way to ensure your Windows PC is clean and optimized.

Beginner’s Section: Troubleshooting Basic Issues

6\. Check for Disk Errors with Windows Error Checking Go to File Explorer, right-click your C: drive (or other target drive), choose Properties > Tools > Error Checking. Click “Check” to scan and fix file system issues that might prevent proper cleanup.

7\. Update Windows and Device Drivers Outdated Windows or drivers may cause disk optimization issues. Open Settings > Windows Update, and install any pending updates. Also, visit your PC manufacturer's website for the latest storage controller or chipset drivers.

8\. Free Up Space with Storage Sense Windows 10 and 11 offer Storage Sense (Settings > System > Storage > Storage Sense). Toggle it on to automate cleanup tasks like temporary file removal and old downloads purging. You can configure how often it runs and what it cleans.

9\. Deal with Locked Files and Permissions Sometimes, Disk Cleanup can’t remove certain files due to permissions or because they are in use. Boot into Safe Mode (Settings > Recovery > Advanced startup > Restart now), then rerun Disk Cleanup or manually delete stubborn files.

10\. Defragment or Optimize Drives Mechanical drives benefit from defragmentation. Open “Defragment and Optimize Drives” from the Start menu, select your drive, and click “Optimize.” SSDs don’t need defragmenting, but running the tool’s “Optimize” function helps Windows send TRIM commands, improving SSD longevity.

Glary Utilities also includes a Disk Defrag module that provides detailed reports and can be scheduled for regular optimization, making it convenient for both HDD and SSD users.

11\. Remove System Restore Points (Carefully) Old restore points can consume significant disk space. To delete them, open System Properties > System Protection > Configure, and use the “Delete” button. Only do this if you have recent backups or are certain you don’t need old restore data.

12\. Explore Advanced Cleanup with Command-Line Tools For advanced users, the Command Prompt and PowerShell offer powerful cleanup and repair commands: - Cleanmgr.exe /sageset:1 then Cleanmgr.exe /sagerun:1 to automate advanced cleanup tasks - DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth to repair Windows images - SFC /scannow to scan and automatically fix system file corruption These commands can resolve issues that prevent Disk Cleanup from running or completing successfully.

Real-World Example: Combining Methods for Maximum Effect Let’s say a PC is running low on space, and Disk Cleanup keeps freezing. An effective plan might be: 1. Start in Safe Mode and run Disk Cleanup as administrator. 2. Use [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com)’ 1-Click Maintenance to clean junk and fix registry errors. 3.

Conclusion

Disk cleanup and optimization are crucial for a fast, stable Windows experience.
