Windows 10 and 11 have made significant improvements to user privacy controls, yet tracking and maintaining your privacy remains an ongoing task. Understanding how Windows manages your data and how you can monitor and enhance these settings ensures your information is as secure as possible. This article provides practical steps and real-world advice on how to actively oversee privacy enhancements in Windows, catering to both beginners and advanced users.

1\. Review and Adjust Privacy Settings Regularly

Beginners: Open the Windows Settings app and navigate to Privacy & security. Here, review options such as Location, Camera, Microphone, and Account info. Toggle off permissions for apps you don’t use or trust. Review the Diagnostic data section and set it to “Required only” to minimize what Microsoft collects. Advanced Users: Use the Group Policy Editor (gpedit.msc) to disable data collection at the OS level. Leverage registry edits to fine-tune telemetry and block non-essential data transfers.

2\. Monitor App Permissions and Background Activity

Beginners: Within Privacy & security, select App permissions. Review which apps can access your photos, documents, contacts, and more. Disable any unnecessary permissions. Check which apps are allowed to run in the background and disable those you do not need.

Advanced Users: Use Windows PowerShell to list all permissions granted to installed apps with the command: Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers | Select Name, PackageFullName Combine this with Windows Task Manager or Resource Monitor to observe app behavior in real time.

3\. Control Activity History and Timeline

Beginners: Go to Settings > Privacy & security > Activity history. Turn off “Store my activity history on this device” and “Send my activity history to Microsoft.”

Advanced Users: Clear previous activity history by clicking the “Clear” button in the Activity history section. Use the Diagnostic Data Viewer to audit what historical activity Windows retains.

4\. Utilize [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) for Privacy Cleanup

Both Levels: [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) features a Privacy Cleaner tool, which scans and removes traces of your activity, such as browser history, recent document lists, and temporary files. Schedule regular cleanups to ensure unwanted records are purged. This not only protects privacy but also optimizes system performance.

5\. Inspect and Manage Wi-Fi and Network Sharing Settings

Beginners: Under Network & Internet settings, review Wi-Fi and Ethernet properties. Turn off sharing options like “Find devices and content” on public networks. Disable Wi-Fi Sense and automatic connections to open networks.

Advanced Users: Use netstat and Windows Firewall to monitor incoming/outgoing connections. Block or restrict telemetry endpoints via firewall rules for more granular control.

6\. Audit Microsoft Account and Sync Settings

Beginners: Decide if you want to use a local account instead of a Microsoft account for less cloud-based syncing. Navigate to Settings > Accounts > Sync your settings and selectively disable sync features such as themes, passwords, and browser data.

Advanced Users: Review your Microsoft Account online dashboard for privacy controls, device sign-ins, and data Microsoft stores. Remove devices you no longer use and revoke app permissions as needed.

7\. Track and Manage Cortana and Search Data

Beginners: Open Settings > Privacy & security > Speech, inking, & typing and turn off speech recognition if not needed. Disable Cortana from accessing your calendar, email, messages, and browsing history.

Advanced Users: Delete stored Cortana data from the cloud via your Microsoft Account privacy dashboard.

8\. Regularly Check Windows Updates for Privacy Features

Both Levels: Windows often releases privacy-related enhancements through updates. Ensure your system stays current by regularly checking Windows Update. Review update notes to understand what privacy changes have been implemented and adjust your settings accordingly.

9\. Monitor Third-Party App and Driver Updates

Beginners: Update your apps and drivers from trusted sources only. Avoid third-party driver updaters or privacy tools not widely recognized.

Advanced Users: Inspect update changelogs for data collection policy changes. Use tools like Autoruns from Sysinternals to monitor new startup entries or background services installed by updates.

10\. Use Privacy Reports and Third-Party Privacy Dashboards

Both Levels: Microsoft’s Privacy Dashboard online (https://account.microsoft.com/privacy) allows you to view and manage data Microsoft has collected, such as browsing, search, and location history. Glary Utilities provides a one-stop Privacy & Security dashboard, giving you an overview of privacy threats, cookies, and sensitive files. Use it to schedule scans, erase tracking traces, and stay informed about potential issues.

Conclusion

Consistently monitoring and enhancing privacy on Windows 10 and 11 is crucial for both security and peace of mind. Beginners benefit from straightforward Settings controls and the automated assistance of tools like [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com), while advanced users can leverage Windows’ more technical options for deeper oversight. By combining these top 10 strategies, you can take comprehensive control of your digital privacy and adapt quickly as privacy features evolve.
