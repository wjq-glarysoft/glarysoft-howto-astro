\- Open Device Manager by right-clicking the Start button and selecting 'Device Manager.' - Expand the 'Network adapters' section. - Right-click your network adapter and choose 'Update driver.' - Select 'Search automatically for updated driver software.'

2\. What is the Best Way to Adjust Your Network Settings? Windows 11 has built-in network optimization features that can be tweaked for better performance.

\- Go to Settings > Network & Internet > Status. - Click on 'Network troubleshooter' to let Windows diagnose and fix common issues. - Ensure you're connected to the appropriate network and check your 'Network & Sharing Center' for any misconfigurations.

3\. How to Manage Background Applications? Background applications can consume bandwidth, slowing down your network.

\- Open Settings > Apps > Apps & features. - Click on the three-dot menu next to an app and select 'Advanced options.' - Under 'Background apps permissions,' choose 'Never' to prevent the app from using bandwidth in the background.

\- Open Settings > Network & Internet > Ethernet or Wi-Fi. - Click on 'Edit' under 'IP assignment.' - Select 'Manual' and toggle 'IPv4.' - Enter a preferred DNS server, such as Google's 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4.

6\. How Can You Optimize TCP/IP Settings? TCP/IP optimization can significantly impact performance by adjusting settings like MTU and RWIN.

\- Use the Command Prompt (Admin) and run specific netsh commands such as: - netsh int tcp set global autotuninglevel=normal - netsh int tcp set heuristics disabled

7\. How to Utilize Quality of Service (QoS) Settings? Configuring QoS can prioritize network traffic, crucial for smoother video calls and gaming.

\- Open Group Policy Editor by typing 'gpedit.msc' in the search bar. - Navigate to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Network > QoS Packet Scheduler. - Enable 'Limit reservable bandwidth' and set a percentage lower than the default 20%.

8\. What Role Does Network Bandwidth Play? Monitoring and managing your network bandwidth helps prioritize critical tasks.

\- Use task manager to check which apps are using the most bandwidth. - Go to Settings > Network & Internet > Data usage to set data limits and billing periods.

9\. How to Secure Your Network? Security settings can impact performance, especially if your network is open to intrusions.

\- Use a strong WPA3 encryption on your router. - Change default passwords and disable remote management features.
