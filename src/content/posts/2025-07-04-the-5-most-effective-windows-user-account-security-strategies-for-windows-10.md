Securing user accounts in Windows 10 is vital for protecting sensitive data, maintaining privacy, and ensuring overall system integrity. Advanced users are responsible for more than just basic defenses—they often manage multiple accounts, interact with remote desktops, and configure devices for a range of uses. This article explores the five most effective and time-saving strategies to enhance Windows 10 user account security, offering actionable steps and real-world guidance.

Why Use Multi-Factor Authentication Instead of Just Strong Passwords?

While strong passwords are a baseline requirement, multi-factor authentication (MFA) significantly elevates account security. Even if a password is compromised, unauthorized access is blocked without the secondary authentication factor.

How to implement: 1. Open Windows Settings and navigate to Accounts > Sign-in options. 2. Enable Windows Hello for biometric authentication (fingerprint, facial recognition, or PIN). 3. For business users, configure Azure AD or Microsoft 365 MFA for all user accounts. Use the Microsoft Authenticator app or physical security keys (FIDO2 compatible) for seamless sign-in. 4. For remote desktop access, require MFA at the gateway or VPN level.

Real-world example: A company laptop stolen from a conference can’t be accessed even if the password is known if facial recognition and a security key are required.

How Can You Limit Privilege Using User Account Control (UAC) and Account Separation?

Running everyday tasks as a standard user, and only elevating to admin when necessary, is one of the oldest but most effective principles—least privilege.

How to implement: 1. Create separate standard user and administrator accounts via Control Panel > User Accounts > Manage another account. 2. Use the administrator account exclusively for software installations or configuration changes. 3. Adjust UAC settings to Always Notify for administrator actions: Open Control Panel > Security and Maintenance > Change User Account Control settings. 4. For script automation, use “Run as different user” (Shift + right-click) to execute programs with required privileges without logging out.

Real-world example: An advanced user browsing the internet as a standard user is far less likely to have malware make system-level changes, even if a drive-by attack occurs.

What Is the Best Way to Audit Account Activity and Automate Maintenance?

Regularly monitoring account activity and system logs can help detect unauthorized attempts and spot risky configurations early. Automating log reviews saves valuable time.

How to implement: 1. Open Event Viewer (eventvwr.msc) and set up Custom Views to filter for account logon failures, privilege escalation, and account creation events. 2. Use Task Scheduler to run PowerShell scripts that email daily or weekly security event summaries. 3. Leverage [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com)’ built-in Tracks Eraser and Privacy Cleaner to regularly clear sensitive traces from Windows activity logs, browsers, and other apps, reducing forensic exposure without manual effort.

Real-world example: An admin receives a daily email summary when failed logon attempts spike, allowing quick response to brute-force attempts without constant hands-on monitoring.

How Can You Harden Remote Account Access in a Time-Efficient Manner?

Remote access is a top target for attackers. Hardening RDP and other remote channels can be streamlined with group policies and credential management.

How to implement: 1. Disable RDP for accounts that don’t require it via System Properties > Remote > Select Users. 2. Force Network Level Authentication (NLA) for RDP sessions. 3. Limit login attempts with Account Lockout Policies (run gpedit.msc > Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Account Lockout Policy). 4. Use encrypted password managers and set strong, unique passwords for every remote login. Glary Utilities’ Password Manager can securely generate and store credentials.

Real-world example: A sysadmin restricts RDP to a single hardened account, enforces NLA, and automates lockout after three failed attempts—preventing most brute-force intrusions.

Why Should You Regularly Review and Clean Up Accounts and Permissions?

Unused or forgotten accounts are a prime target for attackers. Regular audits and permission reviews ensure only the right people have access, reducing your attack surface.

How to implement: 1. Run lusrmgr.msc to list all local accounts. Disable or remove any that are no longer needed. 2. Use net localgroup administrators to check group memberships and remove unnecessary admin privileges. 3. Glary Utilities’ Account Manager can provide an at-a-glance overview of user accounts, making it quick to spot anomalies or redundant entries. 4. Schedule monthly reviews—set a recurring calendar reminder or automate a PowerShell script that logs changes to accounts and group memberships.

Real-world example: After a contractor leaves a project, their account is promptly disabled and removed from all groups, preventing future misuse or accidental exposure.

Conclusion

Advanced Windows 10 users can dramatically improve user account security by going beyond simple password protection. Multi-factor authentication, strict privilege management, automated auditing, remote access hardening, and regular account cleanups form a comprehensive, time-efficient defense. Leveraging utilities like [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) for account management, credential storage, and privacy protection further streamlines these best practices, making it easier to maintain robust security without sacrificing productivity.
