The Windows command line might seem intimidating to beginners, but it’s a powerful way to diagnose, maintain, and optimize your PC. With just a few typed commands, you can perform tasks that would take much longer with mouse clicks. In this article, we’ll introduce you to the most useful Windows command line tools, explain how they work, and provide practical examples you can try yourself. We'll also show you how Glary Utilities offers even easier alternatives for those who prefer graphical interfaces.

What Is the Command Line in Windows?

The command line (also known as Command Prompt or CMD) is a text-based interface where you type commands for your PC to execute. To open it, press the Windows key, type "cmd," and press Enter. For some tasks, you'll need to run as administrator: right-click Command Prompt and select "Run as administrator."

Which Command Line Tools Should Beginners Learn First?

While Windows offers dozens of command line tools, these essentials are particularly helpful for beginners:

IPCONFIG – How Can I Check My Network Settings?

The IPCONFIG tool shows your network information. This is useful if you’re troubleshooting a network problem or need your PC's IP address.

Example: Type ipconfig and press Enter. You’ll see a list of your network adapters and their IP addresses.

For more details, type: ipconfig /all

SFC – How Do I Repair System Files?

The System File Checker (SFC) command scans Windows system files and repairs any that are corrupted.

To use SFC: 1. Open Command Prompt as administrator. 2. Type sfc /scannow and press Enter. 3. Wait for the scan to complete. If it finds issues, Windows will attempt to repair them automatically.

CHKDSK – How Do I Check My Hard Drive for Errors?

CHKDSK (Check Disk) examines your hard drive for problems and attempts to fix them.

To run a basic scan: chkdsk

For a thorough check and repair, use: chkdsk /f /r

You may be asked to restart your PC. Upon reboot, CHKDSK will scan and repair your drive.

DISM – How Can I Restore My Windows Image?

The Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool (DISM) repairs Windows images, which can fix problems that SFC can’t.

To use DISM: 1. Open Command Prompt as administrator. 2. Type DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth and press Enter. 3. Wait for the process to finish—this may take some time.

TASKLIST and TASKKILL – How Can I Manage Running Processes?

TASKLIST displays all running programs and processes. TASKKILL lets you end a process.

To see all running processes, type: tasklist

To end a frozen program, use: taskkill /IM programname.exe /F

For example, to close Notepad: taskkill /IM notepad.exe /F
