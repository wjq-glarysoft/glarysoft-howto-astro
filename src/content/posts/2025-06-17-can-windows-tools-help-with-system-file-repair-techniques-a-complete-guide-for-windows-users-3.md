Keeping your Windows PC running smoothly depends on more than just deleting old files or uninstalling unused programs. Over time, your system files—the essential components that make Windows function—can become corrupted or go missing. This can lead to slowdowns, crashes, or persistent error messages. Fortunately, Windows offers built-in tools to repair these issues, and third-party solutions like Glary Utilities can simplify or enhance the process. This guide will walk you through proven system file repair techniques, suitable for both beginners and advanced users.

What Are System Files and Why Do They Matter?

System files are critical components of your Windows operating system. They include drivers, dynamic link libraries (DLLs), and core executables. If any of these files are damaged or missing, Windows can misbehave or even fail to boot.

Common signs of system file problems: - Frequent blue screen errors - Programs failing to start - System freezes or sluggishness - Error messages about missing DLLs

Beginner’s Section: Basic System Repair Techniques

1\. Using System File Checker (SFC)

Windows includes the System File Checker tool, which scans and repairs corrupted system files.

How to run SFC: - Click the Start menu, type cmd, right-click on Command Prompt, and select “Run as administrator.” - In the Command Prompt window, type sfc /scannow and press Enter. - Wait for the scan to reach 100%. The tool will automatically repair any detected issues.

Tips: - Make sure to save your work before starting, as you may need to restart your PC. - If SFC reports errors it cannot fix, move on to the next method.

2\. Using DISM (Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool)

If SFC can’t repair everything, DISM can help fix underlying Windows image issues.

How to use DISM: - Open Command Prompt as an administrator. - Type DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth and press Enter. - Allow the process to finish—it may take several minutes. - Afterward, rerun SFC to check if issues are resolved.

Real-world example: A user experiences errors after a recent Windows update. Running SFC finds some corrupt files but can’t fix them. Using DISM resolves the issue, and SFC then completes successfully.

Advanced Section: Manual Recovery and Prevention Tactics

For experienced users, sometimes built-in tools and third-party utilities aren’t enough. Here are additional steps:

System Restore: - Open the Start menu, type “Create a restore point,” and select it. - Click “System Restore,” choose a recent point before the problem started, and follow the prompts.

Manual File Replacement: - Identify the corrupted or missing file (often named in error messages). - Search for the file in a working Windows installation or trusted online source. - Replace the file in its correct directory (e.g., C:\\Windows\\System32), taking care to back up the original.
