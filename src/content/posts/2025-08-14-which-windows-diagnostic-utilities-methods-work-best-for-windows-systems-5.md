Keeping a Windows PC healthy is mostly about knowing which tool to use for the symptom you see. This beginner-friendly guide walks through the built-in diagnostics that solve the most common problems, with step-by-step instructions and simple examples. It also shows where Glary Utilities can simplify cleanup and performance checks in one place.

What should you try first when Windows feels slow?

Start with Task Manager to see what is using your CPU, memory, disk, and network. This points you to the cause in seconds.

Steps - Press Ctrl+Shift+Esc to open Task Manager. - If you see a simple view, click More details. - Click the Processes tab and sort by CPU, Memory, or Disk to find what’s on top. - Click the Startup tab to see apps that start with Windows. Note the “Startup impact” column. - To disable a nonessential startup app: right-click it, choose Disable, restart the PC.

Example - If Disk shows near 100% for several minutes and a single app is on top, that app is your slowdown. If multiple Windows processes are active, click the Performance tab, then Open Resource Monitor, and expand Disk to see which files are being read or written.

How do you find and explain crashes or errors quickly?

Use Reliability Monitor for a simple, day-by-day stability timeline.

Steps - Press the Windows key, type reliability, and open View reliability history. - Look for red X (critical events) or yellow warning icons on the timeline. - Click a day, then click an event to read its summary and details. - Click View technical details to see the faulting app or module name.

What to look for - Repeated “Windows Installer” or “Application Hang” events suggest a specific app is causing trouble. - “Hardware error” entries around the time of a freeze point toward drivers or hardware.

How do you run a quick network diagnosis?

Windows has a built-in troubleshooter to reset adapters and check settings.

Windows 11 steps - Open Settings. - Go to System > Troubleshoot > Other troubleshooters. - Run Internet Connections. If the problem is with a specific adapter, also run Network Adapter.

Windows 10 steps - Open Settings. - Go to Update & Security > Troubleshoot > Additional troubleshooters. - Run Internet Connections and Network Adapter.

Tip for reading results - “Reset the Wi‑Fi adapter” indicates Windows changed adapter settings; test your connection again. - If the troubleshooter reports “couldn’t identify the problem,” check your router or try another device to rule out internet issues.

How do you check your disk for errors and health?

Start with the graphical Error Checking tool. If needed, follow up with System File Checker.

Disk Error Checking - Press Windows key + E to open File Explorer. - On the left, click This PC. - Right‑click your system drive (usually C:), choose Properties. - Go to the Tools tab, click Check under Error checking. - If prompted to schedule at next restart, accept, then reboot.

System File Checker (SFC) to repair system files - Press Windows key, type cmd. - Right‑click Command Prompt and choose Run as administrator. - Type sfc /scannow and press Enter. Wait for it to finish.

What success looks like - “Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations.” means your system files are fine. - “Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files and successfully repaired them.” means it fixed issues. - If SFC reports it could not repair some files, run: - DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth - When DISM finishes, run sfc /scannow again.

How do you test your RAM when you see blue screens or random freezes?

Use Windows Memory Diagnostic.

Steps - Press the Windows key, type Windows Memory Diagnostic, open it. - Choose Restart now and check for problems. - The PC restarts and runs tests. When Windows loads, results appear in a notification.

If you miss the notification, check results manually - Press Windows key + R, type eventvwr.msc, press Enter. - In the left pane, expand Windows Logs, click System. - On the right, click Find, type MemoryDiagnostics-Results, press Enter. - A result of “no errors” rules out basic memory issues. Errors suggest faulty RAM or settings.

How do you check graphics, sound, and driver basics in one place?

Use DirectX Diagnostic Tool (DxDiag) to collect system info and spot driver issues.

Steps - Press Windows key + R. - Type dxdiag and press Enter. - Check the System tab for OS and BIOS details. - Open the Display tab to see graphics driver version and notes. - Open the Sound tab to verify audio devices and drivers.

What to look for - “No problems found” is a good baseline. If you see problems or outdated drivers, update from the device manufacturer’s website or Windows Update.

How do you spot resource hogs over time, not just in the moment?

Resource Monitor groups CPU, Disk, Network, and Memory activity with more detail than Task Manager.

Steps - Open Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc), go to the Performance tab, click Open Resource Monitor. - Click the Disk tab to see which files are active. - Click the Memory tab to see which apps commit the most RAM. - Sort columns to bring heavy users to the top.

Real-world example - A constantly high disk queue length and heavy activity on C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution often means Windows Update is catching up. Let it finish, then performance returns to normal.

How do you manage space and clean safely without breaking things?

Windows can clear temporary files, and Glary Utilities can go deeper while keeping it safe for beginners.

Steps - Press Windows key + X, choose Device Manager. - Look for any device with a yellow warning icon. - Right‑click the device, choose Update driver, then Search automatically for drivers. - If Windows reports the best drivers are already installed, visit the device manufacturer’s support page for the newest version.

How do you run Windows troubleshooters for common problems fast?

Windows 11 - Settings > System > Troubleshoot > Other troubleshooters. - Run troubleshooters for Internet Connections, Playing Audio, Printer, Windows Update, and others when a related issue appears.

Windows 10 - Settings > Update & Security > Troubleshoot > Additional troubleshooters. - Run the relevant troubleshooter for the symptom you see.

What routine keeps a beginner PC healthy without overthinking?

A light, repeatable plan uses the best of Windows tools plus Glary Utilities.

Monthly quick health check - Run Windows Update and reboot. - Open Reliability Monitor for a 30‑second scan of red or yellow events and address repeats. - Run Disk Error Checking on C: if you’ve had sudden power loss or freezes. - Run SFC if system files were changed or after removing malware. - Open Glary Utilities and run 1-Click Maintenance to clear junk, fix shortcuts, and review startup items.

Which methods work best overall?

For fast answers, start with Task Manager and Reliability Monitor. For repairs, use Disk Error Checking and SFC, with DISM as a backup when SFC can’t finish the job.
