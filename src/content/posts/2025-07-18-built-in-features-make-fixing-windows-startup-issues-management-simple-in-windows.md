Windows startup issues can quickly turn a productive day into a troubleshooting marathon. Fortunately, Windows includes a range of built-in features that simplify the process of diagnosing and fixing these problems, saving users valuable time. This article explores practical methods—using both native tools and third-party solutions like [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com)—for resolving startup issues efficiently. Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced user, you’ll find actionable steps and real-world examples to help you get your PC running smoothly again.

Why Do Windows Startup Issues Happen?

Before diving into solutions, it’s important to understand common causes of startup problems. These issues may arise from corrupted system files, problematic updates, unnecessary startup programs, malware, or failing hardware. Recognizing these causes will help you choose the right tool and method to resolve the problem quickly.

Beginner Section: Quick Fixes Using Built-in Windows Tools

What should you try first when Windows won’t start properly?

1\. Use Startup Repair Windows offers an automated Startup Repair tool designed to fix common boot problems.

Step-by-step: - Restart your computer and as soon as Windows begins to load, press and hold the Shift key while clicking "Restart" from the login screen. - Select Troubleshoot > Advanced options > Startup Repair. - Choose your account, enter your password, and let Windows scan and attempt repairs.

This tool can automatically resolve issues like missing system files or problematic updates, often restoring normal startup in a few minutes.

2\. Remove Unnecessary Startup Programs Too many programs set to launch at startup can slow down or freeze boot-up.

How to manage startup items: - Right-click the taskbar and select Task Manager. - Go to the Startup tab. - Disable any programs you don’t need immediately after logging in (e.g., chat apps or updaters).

Reducing startup clutter can noticeably improve boot times and reduce errors.

3\. Run Disk Cleanup Corrupted temporary files sometimes interfere with startup.

Steps: - Open the Start menu, type “Disk Cleanup,” and select it. - Choose your system drive (usually C:) and let the tool calculate files to remove. - Check items like “Temporary files” and “Recycle Bin” for removal, then click OK.

Advanced Section: Deeper Diagnosis and Repair

How can advanced users address stubborn startup issues?

1\. Use System File Checker (SFC) and DISM Corrupt system files can prevent Windows from starting.

How to use SFC: - Open Command Prompt as administrator (right-click Start and select Windows Terminal (Admin) or Command Prompt (Admin)). - Type sfc /scannow and hit Enter. - Let the scan finish; if problems are found, the tool will attempt to fix them.

If SFC can’t repair files, use DISM: - In the same Command Prompt window, type dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth and press Enter.

2\. Check Event Viewer for Clues Advanced users can check the Event Viewer for detailed logs about startup failures.

Steps: - Right-click Start and select Event Viewer. - Expand Windows Logs, select System, and look for errors or warnings around the last boot time. - Use these details to identify and address troublesome services or drivers.

3\. Use Safe Mode for Troubleshooting Booting into Safe Mode loads only essential drivers and services.

How to enter Safe Mode: - Hold Shift and click Restart as described earlier. - Go to Troubleshoot > Advanced options > Startup Settings > Restart. - Select Safe Mode or Safe Mode with Networking.

Once in Safe Mode, you can uninstall problematic software, run antivirus scans, or roll back recent driver updates.
