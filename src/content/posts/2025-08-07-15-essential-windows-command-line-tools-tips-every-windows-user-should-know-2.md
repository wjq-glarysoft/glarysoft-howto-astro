The Windows command line, or Command Prompt, is a powerful tool often overlooked by everyday users. Professionals know that mastering command line tools can greatly enhance productivity, streamline troubleshooting, and automate repetitive tasks. Here are 15 essential tips covering Windows command line tools every user should know, with practical advice for both beginners and advanced enthusiasts.

Getting Started: Tips for Beginners

What is the Command Prompt, and How Do You Access It?

The Command Prompt is a text-based interface that allows you to interact directly with Windows. To open it, press Windows key + R, type "cmd", and hit Enter. For administrative privileges (sometimes necessary for system tools), search for "cmd" in the Start menu, right-click, and select "Run as administrator".

1\. Navigating the File System with cd, dir, and cls

cd (Change Directory): Move between folders easily. For example, cd Documents changes your working directory to Documents.

dir (Directory): Lists files and folders in the current directory. Try dir /p to pause after each screen or dir /s to show all files, including those in subfolders.

cls (Clear Screen): Clears the command window for easier readability.

2\. Copy, Move, and Delete Files with copy, move, and del

copy: Duplicates files. Example: copy file1.txt backup.txt

move: Transfers a file. Example: move report.docx D:\\Backups

del: Deletes files. Example: del unwantedfile.txt Use caution—there’s no Recycle Bin recovery!

3\. Viewing and Killing Processes with tasklist and taskkill

Check running processes using tasklist. To end a process, use taskkill. Example: taskkill /IM notepad.exe /F

4\. Checking Network Connections with ipconfig and ping

ipconfig: Shows your network configuration. Use ipconfig /all for detailed info, or ipconfig /release and ipconfig /renew to troubleshoot connectivity.

ping: Tests connectivity to another network device. Example: ping google.com

5\. Creating and Running Batch Files

Save repetitive tasks as batch files. Create a text file with commands (one per line), save it as script.bat, and double-click to run. This is great for automating daily system maintenance.

6\. System Information with systeminfo and msinfo32

systeminfo: Displays detailed system configuration. Run systeminfo > info.txt to save it for support purposes.

msinfo32: Opens the graphical System Information tool, providing hardware and software summaries.

7\. Managing Disks with chkdsk and diskpart

chkdsk: Checks disk health and repairs file system errors. Example: chkdsk C: /f

diskpart: Advanced disk management—create, delete, or resize partitions. Use with caution and always back up data!

8\. Finding Files Quickly with dir and where

dir /s filename.ext: Searches all subdirectories for a file.

where appname: Finds the location of an installed program, e.g., where notepad

9\. Using PowerShell for Enhanced Scripting

PowerShell is a more advanced shell with powerful scripting capabilities. Open it by typing "powershell" in the Start menu. Example: Get-Process | Where-Object {$\_.CPU -gt 100}

10\. Scheduling Tasks with schtasks

Automate tasks such as backups or cleanups. Example: schtasks /create /sc daily /tn "DailyBackup" /tr "C:\\Backup.bat" /st 23:00

11\. Monitoring Event Logs with wevtutil

Export Windows Event Logs for troubleshooting: wevtutil qe System /c:10 /f:text > last10events.txt

12\. Managing Users with net user

Add or modify users from the command line. Example: net user newuser password /add

13\. Checking System Uptime and Boot Time

systeminfo | find "System Boot Time" This displays when your PC was last restarted.

14\. Remote System Management with psexec (Sysinternals Suite)

Run processes on remote systems (requires download). Example: psexec \\\\RemotePC cmd

15\. Repairing System Files with sfc and DISM

sfc /scannow: Scans and repairs system files.

DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth: Repairs Windows image, useful when sfc can’t fix issues.
