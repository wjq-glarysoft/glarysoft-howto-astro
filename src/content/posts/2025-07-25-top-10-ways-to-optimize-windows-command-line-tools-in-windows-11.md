The Windows command line is a powerful environment packed with tools that can help you optimize, troubleshoot, and automate tasks on your PC. As Windows 11 continues to evolve, leveraging these built-in command line utilities can streamline daily workflow, improve PC performance, and enhance system maintenance. Whether you're a beginner or an advanced user, here’s how to get the most out of Windows command line tools for system optimization.

Beginner Section: Getting Started With the Basics

1\. How Do I Access and Use Command Prompt & PowerShell?

Accessing Command Line Tools: - Press Windows + X, then select “Windows Terminal” or “Command Prompt.” - Alternatively, type “cmd” or “powershell” in the Start menu and press Enter.

Basic Commands to Try: - dir: Lists files and folders in the current directory. - cd: Changes the directory. - cls: Clears the screen for a fresh view. - help: Displays a list of available commands.

Real-World Example: Open Command Prompt and type dir to see the contents of your Documents folder. Use cd Documents to navigate into that folder.

2\. How Can I Check and Repair Disk Errors Easily?

The chkdsk Utility: - Command: chkdsk C: /f /r - What It Does: Scans the disk for errors and repairs them. - How to Use: Open Command Prompt as administrator. Type the above command and press Enter. If prompted to schedule on next restart, press Y.

Pro tip: Always backup data before running disk repairs.

3\. What’s the Fastest Way to Free Up Space Using Command Line?

The cleanmgr Tool: - Command: cleanmgr /sagerun:1 - How to Use: First, run cleanmgr /sageset:1 to select cleanup options. Then, use the sagerun command to execute your chosen cleanup. - Benefit: Automates the cleanup process without navigating through menus.

Command line cleaning can remove temporary files, system cache, and more, but for deeper maintenance, consider [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) for scheduled and thorough PC cleanups.

4\. How Can I Find and Kill Unresponsive Processes?

Tasklist and Taskkill: - View running processes: tasklist - End a process: taskkill /IM processname.exe /F Example: To end notepad, use taskkill /IM notepad.exe /F

This is particularly handy when a program won’t close from the desktop.

5\. How Can I Optimize Network Settings Quickly?

ipconfig and netsh: - Release/Renew IP: ipconfig /release then ipconfig /renew - Flush DNS Cache: ipconfig /flushdns - Reset Network: netsh int ip reset

These commands help resolve connectivity issues and refresh network settings, saving you from multiple reboots.

6\. How Can I Schedule System Maintenance Tasks?

The schtasks Command: - Create a scheduled task: schtasks /create /tn "DiskCleanup" /tr "cleanmgr.exe" /sc weekly /st 09:00 - What It Does: Schedules Disk Cleanup to run every week at 9:00 AM.

Combine this with [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com)’ built-in scheduler for even more flexible, automated maintenance routines.

7\. How Do I Monitor System Performance in Real-Time?

The perfmon and resmon Tools: - Launch Performance Monitor: perfmon - Launch Resource Monitor: resmon

From the command line, you can open these advanced tools to track CPU, memory, and disk usage, great for diagnosing sluggish performance.

8\. How Can I Detect and Fix Corrupted System Files?

The sfc and DISM Utilities: - Scan and repair system files: sfc /scannow - Repair Windows image: DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth

These commands fix corrupted Windows components that can cause performance issues or crashes.

9\. How Do I Quickly Gather System Information?

Systeminfo and msinfo32: - View detailed system info: systeminfo - Open System Information GUI: msinfo32

Ideal for troubleshooting or preparing for upgrades, these commands give you a full system summary.

10\. How Can I Securely Delete Sensitive Files?

The cipher Tool: - Command: cipher /w:C:\\folder - What It Does: Overwrites deleted data in the specified folder, making recovery impossible.

This approach is far more secure than simply deleting files.
