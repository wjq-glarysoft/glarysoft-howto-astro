Startup issues are among the most frustrating problems that Windows users encounter. A PC that refuses to boot properly can put a halt to your productivity and create unnecessary panic. Fortunately, there are a range of solutions available, from simple fixes to advanced troubleshooting steps. This guide provides actionable advice for both beginners and advanced users, with a focus on practical examples and step-by-step instructions, especially in the context of Clean Up & Repair. We also recommend using [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) for comprehensive maintenance and repair.

Basic Solutions for Beginners: Quick Fixes for Windows Startup Issues

Is Your PC Really Not Starting?

Before diving into technical solutions, make sure the issue isn’t related to power or basic hardware. Check that the power cable is secure, the monitor is on, and all external devices are properly connected. Sometimes, a loose cable or faulty power source can mimic startup problems.

Can You Access Safe Mode?

Safe Mode is one of the most useful diagnostic tools in Windows. It loads only the essential drivers and services. Here's how to enter Safe Mode:

1\. Restart your PC. 2. As Windows starts, press F8 (for Windows 7) or hold Shift and select Restart (for Windows 10/11). 3. Choose Troubleshoot > Advanced options > Startup Settings > Restart. 4. After restart, select Safe Mode.

If your computer boots in Safe Mode, the problem is likely due to a recent software change, driver update, or startup program.

Using Glary Utilities for Basic Repair

Glary Utilities is a user-friendly tool for beginners and advanced users alike. Here’s how to use it for startup issues:

1\. Download and install Glary Utilities from the official website. 2. Open the program and select 1-Click Maintenance. 3. Check all cleanup options, especially Registry Cleaner and Shortcuts Fixer. 4. Run the scan and fix detected issues.

Glary Utilities can automatically clean up registry errors and remove broken shortcuts that might hinder startup.

Have You Tried System Restore?

System Restore can revert your PC to a previous state when it was working correctly.

1\. Boot into Safe Mode (see above). 2. Open the Start menu and type System Restore. 3. Follow prompts to select a restore point before the problem occurred.

How to Disable Problematic Startup Programs

Malicious or poorly designed startup programs can delay or block Windows startup.

1\. Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager. 2. Go to the Startup tab. 3. Right-click and disable any suspicious or unnecessary items.

Glary Utilities also offers a Startup Manager under its Advanced Tools. This feature lists all startup items and helps you easily disable or delay them.

Repairing Windows Boot Files Using Startup Repair

1\. Boot from a Windows installation USB/DVD. 2. Select Repair your computer > Troubleshoot > Advanced options > Startup Repair. 3. Follow the on-screen instructions.

Corrupted disk sectors or file system errors can prevent Windows from starting. Use Windows’ built-in Check Disk utility:

1\. Boot into Safe Mode with Command Prompt. 2. Type chkdsk /f /r C: and press Enter. 3. Allow the scan and repair process to complete.

Advanced Techniques: Expert-Level Solutions for Persistent Startup Issues

How to Use System File Checker (SFC) and Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM)

System file corruption can block Windows from starting. These utilities fix system files:

1\. Boot into Safe Mode with Command Prompt. 2. Type sfc /scannow and press Enter. 3. If issues persist, type DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth and press Enter.

What If You Need to Repair the Master Boot Record (MBR)?

Corrupt MBRs are common causes of boot failure, especially after a failed dual-boot or malware infection.

1\. Boot from a Windows installation USB/DVD. 2. Select Repair your computer > Troubleshoot > Command Prompt. 3. Enter these commands one by one: bootrec /fixmbr bootrec /fixboot bootrec /scanos bootrec /rebuildbcd

How to Analyze Boot Logs

Advanced users can analyze boot logs for in-depth troubleshooting.

1\. Enable boot logging by pressing F8 during startup and selecting Enable Boot Logging. 2. After a failed boot, access the file C:\\Windows\\ntbtlog.txt in Safe Mode. 3. Review the log for failed or problematic drivers and services.

Using Glary Utilities for Advanced Repair and Cleanup

\- Registry Repair: Tackle advanced registry corruption. - Disk Repair: Scan and fix hard drive errors. - Context Menu Manager: Remove problematic shell extensions affecting startup. - Process Manager: Identify suspicious processes running at boot.
