Protecting your privacy on Windows goes beyond basic antivirus software. With the increasing amount of personal data processed by Windows systems, it's essential to take proactive steps to safeguard your information. Below, you’ll find seven expert-recommended privacy enhancement strategies, complete with practical examples and step-by-step instructions. Whether you're a beginner just starting to think about privacy, or an advanced user aiming to fine-tune your system, these strategies will help you maintain control over your digital footprint.

1\. Control Windows Telemetry and Data Collection

Beginner Steps: Windows collects diagnostic data to help improve user experience, but you can limit what's sent to Microsoft.

\- Open Settings. - Go to Privacy & security, then Diagnostics & feedback. - Set Diagnostic data to “Required only.” - Turn off “Tailored experiences” and “View diagnostic data” options for additional privacy.

Advanced Steps: For even stricter control, use the Group Policy Editor (Pro/Enterprise versions only):

\- Press Windows + R, type gpedit.msc, and press Enter. - Navigate to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Data Collection and Preview Builds. - Double-click “Allow Telemetry,” set it to Disabled or “0 – Security,” and click OK.

2\. Limit App Permissions

Beginner Steps: Many apps request access to your camera, microphone, contacts, and other sensitive data.

\- Open Settings. - Go to Privacy & security > App permissions. - Review each category (Location, Camera, Microphone, etc.) and disable access for apps you don't trust or use.

Advanced Steps: To further restrict background app activity:

\- Go to Privacy & security > Background apps. - Turn off background permissions for non-essential apps.

3\. Manage Your Microsoft Account and OneDrive Integration

Beginner Steps: Using a Microsoft account or syncing files with OneDrive offers convenience but also shares more data with the cloud.

\- Sign in with a local account instead of a Microsoft account if you prefer your data stays on your PC. - Open Settings > Accounts > Your info > Sign in with a local account.

To unlink OneDrive: - Right-click the OneDrive icon in your system tray. - Select Settings > Account > Unlink this PC.

Advanced Steps: For advanced users, restrict account sync settings:

\- Go to Settings > Accounts > Windows backup. - Toggle off options for Remember my apps, Preferences, and Passwords if you don’t want this data uploaded.

4\. Harden Your Browser Privacy

Beginner Steps: Browsers are a major source of data leakage.

\- Use privacy-focused browsers like Mozilla Firefox or Microsoft Edge with tracking prevention set to "Strict." - Regularly clear browsing data: Open browser settings > Privacy > Clear browsing data.

Advanced Steps: Install privacy extensions such as uBlock Origin or Privacy Badger, and consider using browser containers to isolate sites.

\- In Firefox, search for "Firefox Multi-Account Containers" in the Add-ons store and install it to compartmentalize browsing.

5\. Use a Comprehensive Privacy Tool: [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com)

Beginner Steps: Glary Utilities is a powerful, user-friendly suite that can help manage privacy settings, clean traces, and optimize your Windows system.

\- Download and install Glary Utilities from the official website. - Open Glary Utilities and select the "Privacy & Security" tab. - Use the "Tracks Eraser" to remove browsing and usage traces. - Run "Disk Cleaner" and "Registry Cleaner" to delete potentially sensitive residual files.

Advanced Steps: Schedule automatic cleaning:

6\. Review and Disable Unnecessary Services

Beginner Steps: Some Windows services may send or share data in the background.

\- Press Windows + R, type services.msc, and press Enter. - Right-click services like “Remote Registry” or “Connected User Experiences and Telemetry,” then select Properties. - Set Startup type to Disabled for services you do not use.

Advanced Steps: Use Autoruns (from Microsoft Sysinternals) to analyze and disable startup items that may compromise privacy:

\- Download Autoruns and review all entries under Logon and Scheduled Tasks. - Uncheck any non-essential or suspicious entries.

7\. Encrypt Your Data

Beginner Steps: Encryption protects your files even if your device is lost or stolen.

\- For Windows Pro/Enterprise users, enable BitLocker: - Open Settings > System > Storage > Advanced storage settings > Disks & volumes. - Select your system drive > Properties > Turn on BitLocker.

If BitLocker isn't available, use third-party tools like VeraCrypt.

Advanced Steps: Enable encryption for removable drives and individual folders using BitLocker To Go or VeraCrypt containers, maintaining strict control over encryption keys and passwords.
