Keeping your Windows PC running smoothly means knowing what’s happening under the hood. Windows 10 and 11 both come packed with powerful system information tools, but many users don’t realize how insightful or helpful they can be for diagnosing issues, planning upgrades, or optimizing performance. This guide will walk you through the built-in tools and introduce you to advanced methods and third-party utilities like [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) for a more comprehensive approach.

Why Should You Check System Information?

Understanding your system’s specs allows you to:

\- Diagnose problems and compatibility issues. - Plan hardware upgrades. - Monitor system health and performance. - Track down drivers or software compatible with your hardware.

Beginner: Getting Started with Built-in Tools

What’s the Easiest Way to See My Basic System Info?

For basic details like Windows version, processor, and RAM:

1\. Press Windows Key + Pause/Break. This opens the System window with a quick summary. 2. Alternatively, right-click the Start button and choose ‘System’.

What’s the Best Tool for In-Depth Hardware Details?

The System Information tool (msinfo32) is your go-to:

1\. Press Windows Key + R to open Run. 2. Type msinfo32 and press Enter. 3. Explore categories on the left: - System Summary gives you OS, BIOS, RAM, etc. - Components > Display shows your graphics card. - Components > Storage shows hard drives and SSDs. - Search box at the bottom lets you find specific info quickly.

How Can I Check Device Health and Drivers?

Device Manager is the answer:

1\. Right-click the Start button. 2. Select Device Manager. 3. Expand categories (like Display adapters, Network adapters) to see what’s installed and if any device shows a yellow exclamation mark (potential issue).

Real-World Example: If your PC suddenly loses audio, check ‘Sound, video and game controllers’ in Device Manager. A missing or flagged driver can be the cause.

Intermediate: Monitoring and Reporting Tools

How Can I See Real-Time Performance Data?

Task Manager and Resource Monitor are essential:

\- Open Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc). - Under the ‘Performance’ tab, see live charts for CPU, Memory, Disk, GPU, and Network. - For more detail, click ‘Open Resource Monitor’ at the bottom. Here, you can track real-time usage by process.

How Do I Generate a System Health Report?

Windows has a hidden gem called ‘Performance Monitor’:

1\. Type ‘Performance Monitor’ in the Start menu and open it. 2. In the left panel, expand ‘Data Collector Sets’, then ‘System’. 3. Right-click ‘System Diagnostics’ and choose ‘Start’. 4. After a few minutes, find your report under ‘Reports’ > ‘System’ > ‘System Diagnostics’.

The report includes hardware, software, driver status, and suggestions if issues are found.

Advanced: Command-Line Tools and Third-Party Utilities

What Command-Line Tools Help Power Users?

PowerShell and Command Prompt offer detailed system queries:

\- To get system info, open Command Prompt and type: systeminfo - For hardware details using PowerShell: Get-ComputerInfo Or target specifics, like memory: Get-WmiObject Win32\_PhysicalMemory

These outputs can be copied for documentation or troubleshooting.

How Can I Get Even More Detail with Third-Party Tools?

For a deeper dive, Glary Utilities is highly recommended. It combines system information with cleanup and optimization features, all in a user-friendly dashboard.
