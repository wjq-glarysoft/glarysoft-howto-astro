Windows startup issues can range from minor annoyances, such as slow boot times, to critical problems like endless restart loops or blue screen errors. Addressing these challenges requires a combination of proven troubleshooting steps, practical repair solutions, and occasional use of third-party tools. This guide will help both beginners and advanced users understand and fix common and advanced startup issues, all with a focus on Clean Up & Repair best practices.

Section 1: Understanding Windows Startup Issues

Before jumping into solutions, it's important to recognize the most frequent startup problems:

\- Slow startup or boot times - Error messages preventing boot - Stuck on the Windows logo or spinning dots - Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) during startup - Endless restart or repair loops

Most startup issues are caused by corrupt system files, problematic drivers, conflicting startup programs, or malware infections. Sometimes, hardware issues like failing drives can also be a culprit.
