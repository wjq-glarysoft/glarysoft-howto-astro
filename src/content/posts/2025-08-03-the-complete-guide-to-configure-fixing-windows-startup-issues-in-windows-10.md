Windows 10 occasionally faces startup issues that prevent your PC from booting correctly. These problems can be frustrating, but most can be resolved with a structured approach. This guide is tailored for intermediate Windows users who want to understand and address common startup issues, using both built-in tools and trusted maintenance software like [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com).

What Are Common Windows 10 Startup Issues?

You may encounter the following signs of startup trouble:

\- Windows gets stuck on the loading screen - Blue screen errors during boot - Automatic Repair loop - Black screen with or without a cursor - Error messages like “Operating System Not Found” or “INACCESSIBLE\_BOOT\_DEVICE”

Understanding the root cause—whether it's corrupt files, driver problems, or hardware issues—is crucial to selecting the right fix.

How Should You Prepare Before Troubleshooting?

1\. Back up your data, if possible, using Safe Mode or another working PC. 2. Keep your Windows 10 installation media or recovery drive handy. 3. Make sure your PC is connected to a reliable power source.

How Can You Use Windows Built-in Tools to Fix Startup Problems?

Step 1: Access Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) If Windows fails to boot three times, WinRE usually loads automatically. If not:

\- Use a USB installation drive or recovery disk. - Boot from this device and choose "Repair your computer".

Step 2: Run Startup Repair - In WinRE, select Troubleshoot > Advanced options > Startup Repair. - Choose your Windows installation and let the tool scan and fix issues.

Practical Example: Your PC gets stuck at the Windows logo. Startup Repair runs an automated scan and might fix missing or corrupt system files. If it reports “Startup Repair couldn’t repair your PC”, move to the next steps.

Step 3: Use System Restore - In Advanced options, select System Restore. - Choose a restore point from when your system worked correctly. - Confirm and let Windows restore system files and settings.

Step 4: Repair Boot Configuration Data (BCD) - Return to Advanced options and open Command Prompt. - Run these commands one by one: bootrec /fixmbr bootrec /fixboot bootrec /scanos bootrec /rebuildbcd

This can resolve problems where Windows can’t find the boot loader.

Step 5: Check Disk Health - In Command Prompt, type chkdsk C: /f /r This checks for disk errors that might prevent a normal startup.

How Can Glary Utilities Help Clean Up and Prevent Startup Problems?

Glary Utilities is a comprehensive maintenance tool that can address several causes of startup issues, especially those related to system clutter and misconfigured startup items.

Here’s how you can use [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) to help:

1\. Download and install [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) from the official website. 2. Open the app and choose "1-Click Maintenance". This feature scans for invalid registry entries, broken shortcuts, and temporary files that often cause boot delays. 3. Use the "Startup Manager" under the "Optimize & Improve" section to view and disable unnecessary startup programs. Too many startup items can slow or freeze the boot process. 4. Run the "Registry Repair" tool to fix registry errors that could be affecting startup. 5. Regularly use the "Disk Repair" tool to scan for and fix errors on your hard drive.

Scenario Example: If your Windows 10 PC boots slowly or occasionally fails to start, running Glary Utilities’ 1-Click Maintenance and disabling non-essential startup programs can streamline the boot process and reduce conflicts.

What If You Need to Enter Safe Mode?

Sometimes, advanced troubleshooting is easier in Safe Mode:

\- From WinRE, select Troubleshoot > Advanced options > Startup Settings > Restart. - After your PC restarts, press 4 or F4 to start in Safe Mode. - In Safe Mode, you can uninstall problematic updates, drivers, or software, and run Glary Utilities for a targeted clean-up.

Should You Reinstall Windows 10?

If all else fails, consider a reset or clean install:

\- In WinRE, select Troubleshoot > Reset this PC. You can choose to keep or remove your files. - For a full reinstall, use the installation media, following on-screen instructions.

How Can You Prevent Future Startup Issues?

\- Regularly update Windows and device drivers. - Use Glary Utilities weekly to clean up files and optimize startup. - Create restore points before major changes. - Keep backups of critical data.

Conclusion

Fixing Windows 10 startup issues requires a mix of built-in repair tools and good maintenance practices. By learning to use tools like Startup Repair, System Restore, and Glary Utilities, you can tackle common problems and keep your system running smoothly. Regular cleanup and startup optimization not only solve current issues but also help prevent new ones from appearing.
