How Do I Use System File Checker (SFC)?

The System File Checker (SFC) is a built-in Windows tool that scans and restores corrupt system files.

1\. Open Command Prompt as Administrator: Press Windows + S, type "cmd", right-click on Command Prompt, and select "Run as administrator".

2\. Execute the Command: Type \`sfc /scannow\` and press Enter. This will initiate a scan of your system files.

Pro Tip: Ensure all applications are closed before running SFC to avoid interference with the scanning process.

Common Mistake: Interrupting the scan can prevent file repairs. Always allow SFC to complete its process uninterrupted.

What If SFC Cannot Repair Files?

Sometimes, SFC might not repair all files. In such cases, use the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool.

1\. Open Command Prompt as Administrator.

2\. Run DISM: Type \`DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth\` and press Enter.

This command will attempt to fix the Windows image, which can resolve the issues preventing SFC from repairing files.
