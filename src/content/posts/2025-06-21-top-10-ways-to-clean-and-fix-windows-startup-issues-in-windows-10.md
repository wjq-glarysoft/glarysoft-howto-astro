Windows 10 startup issues can be frustrating, often leaving you staring at a blank screen, waiting excessively for boot, or even stuck in endless restart loops. As a Windows system expert, I understand how these issues can disrupt productivity and cause unnecessary stress. In this article, we’ll explore the top 10 practical ways to clean up and repair Windows 10 startup problems, from beginner-friendly fixes to advanced techniques for experienced users. To streamline your troubleshooting, I’ll also highlight how [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) can help automate and simplify many of these tasks.

For Beginners: Quick and Effective Startup Repairs

1\. Use Windows Startup Repair

If your PC fails to boot normally, Windows 10’s built-in Startup Repair tool can often resolve the problem automatically.

How to Use: - Force your PC to restart three times (power off and on as soon as you see the Windows logo). This triggers the Windows Recovery Environment. - Click “Troubleshoot” > “Advanced options” > “Startup Repair.” - Select your Windows 10 installation and follow the prompts.

2\. Remove Unnecessary Startup Programs

Too many startup programs can slow down boot time or cause conflicts.

How to Use Task Manager: - Right-click the taskbar and select “Task Manager.” - Go to the “Startup” tab. - Disable programs you don’t need at startup by right-clicking and selecting “Disable.”

Pro Tip: [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) offers a Startup Manager that displays more details and helps you safely disable or delay startup items for a faster, cleaner boot.

3\. Check for Windows Updates

Outdated system files can lead to boot issues. Make sure you’re up to date.

How to Check: - Go to “Settings” > “Update & Security” > “Windows Update.” - Click “Check for updates.” - Install any pending updates and restart your PC.

4\. Clean Up System Junk and Temporary Files

Corrupted or excessive temporary files can hinder startup.

Using Windows Disk Cleanup: - In the Start menu, type “Disk Cleanup” and select the tool. - Choose your system drive (usually C:). - Check boxes for “Temporary files,” “System files,” and other unneeded items. - Click “OK” to clean up.

Better Alternative: Glary Utilities’ 1-Click Maintenance scans for and removes junk files, invalid shortcuts, and other clutter in a single step, ensuring a smoother startup.

5\. Run a Full Virus and Malware Scan

Malware can hijack startup processes, causing delays or preventing boot.

How to Use: - Open Windows Security from the Start menu. - Select “Virus & threat protection” > “Quick scan” or “Full scan.” - Remove any threats found.

Glary Utilities includes a Malware Remover for added protection, working alongside your antivirus software for a deeper clean.

For Advanced Users: Deeper Repairs and Cleanups

6\. Restore System Files with System File Checker (SFC)

Corrupted system files often cause startup errors.

Step-by-Step: - Right-click the Start button and select “Windows Terminal (Admin)” or “Command Prompt (Admin).” - Type sfc /scannow and press Enter. - Let the scan complete and follow any instructions to repair files.

7\. Use DISM to Repair Windows Image

If SFC can’t fix all issues, DISM (Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool) can repair the underlying Windows image.

How to Use: - Open Command Prompt as administrator. - Type DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth and press Enter. - Wait for the process to finish, then restart your PC.

8\. Repair Boot Configuration (BCD)

If you see errors like “Bootmgr is missing,” your boot configuration might be corrupted.

How to Fix: - Boot into Windows Recovery Environment (using a bootable USB if necessary). - Go to “Troubleshoot” > “Advanced options” > “Command Prompt.” - Type and run these commands, each followed by Enter: bootrec /fixmbr bootrec /fixboot bootrec /scanos bootrec /rebuildbcd

9\. Clean Up the Windows Registry

A bloated or corrupted registry can cause startup issues.

Manual edits to the registry are risky. Instead, use Glary Utilities’ Registry Cleaner:

\- Open Glary Utilities and select “Registry Cleaner.” - Scan for registry errors. - Review the results and let the tool safely clean and repair invalid entries.

This reduces the risk of human error and can significantly improve startup reliability.

10\. Perform a Clean Boot

A clean boot helps identify problematic services or drivers.

How to Do It: - In the Start menu, type “msconfig” and open System Configuration. - Under the “Services” tab, check “Hide all Microsoft services.” - Click “Disable all.” - Go to the “Startup” tab and open Task Manager. - Disable all startup items. - Restart your PC. If it boots normally, enable services and startup items one by one to identify the culprit.

Glary Utilities’ Startup Manager can simplify this by allowing you to manage startup items without diving into multiple system tools.

Regular maintenance is key to keeping startup issues at bay. Schedule periodic cleanups, keep software updated, and monitor startup items for unwanted applications. [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) is a comprehensive toolkit that covers junk file removal, registry cleaning, malware protection, and startup management—all crucial for a healthy Windows 10 boot process.
