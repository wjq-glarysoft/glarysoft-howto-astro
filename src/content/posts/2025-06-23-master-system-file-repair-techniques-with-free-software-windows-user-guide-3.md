A healthy Windows system relies on the integrity of its core files. When these essential files become corrupted or go missing, your PC may slow down, show error messages, or even fail to boot properly. Repairing system files doesn’t have to be intimidating—modern Windows offers built-in tools, and several trustworthy free utilities can assist. This guide walks you through proven system file repair methods, combining hands-on steps with practical advice for both novice and experienced users.

Why Do System Files Become Corrupted?

Everyday use, sudden shutdowns, incomplete updates, malware infections, and hardware issues can all damage Windows system files. Early detection and prompt repair are key to avoiding bigger problems down the line.

Section for Beginners: Simple Steps to Check and Repair System Files

Start with Built-In Windows Tools

Step 1: Use System File Checker (SFC) 1. Press the Windows key, type cmd, then right-click Command Prompt and select Run as administrator. 2. In the command window, type sfc /scannow and press Enter. 3. Wait while Windows scans and repairs corrupt files automatically. If problems are found and fixed, restart your computer.

What does SFC do? SFC checks protected system files for corruption and replaces them with clean versions from a local cache.

Step 2: Run the DISM Tool (Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool) 1. Open Command Prompt as administrator again. 2. Enter DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth and press Enter. 3. Be patient—this process can take up to 30 minutes. After completion, restart your PC. 4. Run SFC again for best results.

How does DISM help? DISM repairs the Windows image file used by SFC, ensuring SFC has healthy resources to draw from.
