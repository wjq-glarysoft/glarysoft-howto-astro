Network performance is a critical factor for any Windows user, whether you are streaming movies, playing games, attending online meetings, or transferring files across your home or office network. Slow or unreliable connections can be frustrating, but with the right tweaks and optimizations, you can significantly improve your Windows network experience. Here are ten essential tips for tuning your network performance, with clear steps for both beginners and advanced users.

1\. Check Your Network Hardware

Beginner-friendly tip:

\- Ensure your Ethernet cables are undamaged and properly seated in your network ports. - If you’re using Wi-Fi, position your router in a central, unobstructed spot for best signal coverage. - Restart your router and modem regularly to clear potential bottlenecks.

Advanced tip:

\- Upgrade to Gigabit switches or routers if you’re still on older 100Mbps hardware. - Consider using dual-band or tri-band Wi-Fi routers to minimize congestion, especially in crowded wireless environments.

2\. Keep Windows and Drivers Updated

Beginner-friendly tip:

\- Open Settings, go to Update & Security, and click Windows Update. Install all available updates. - Use Device Manager to check for the latest network adapter drivers.

Advanced tip:

\- Download the latest network drivers directly from your motherboard or network card manufacturer’s website for the most recent performance and compatibility fixes.

3\. Optimize Your Network Adapter Settings

Beginner-friendly tip:

\- Right-click the network icon, select Open Network & Internet settings, then Change adapter options. - Right-click your active adapter, choose Properties, and click Configure. - Under the Advanced tab, adjust settings like Speed & Duplex to match your router (usually Auto Negotiation or 1.0 Gbps Full Duplex for wired).

Advanced tip:

\- Fine-tune settings such as Jumbo Frame, Large Send Offload, and Receive Side Scaling, if your hardware supports them. These can boost throughput and efficiency on modern networks.

4\. Clean Up Network-Related System Clutter

Glary Utilities recommendation:

Over time, network and internet-related junk files accumulate on your system, which can slow performance.

\- Use Glary Utilities’ Disk Cleaner and Tracks Eraser tools to remove obsolete cache, temporary files, and browser leftovers. - Its Startup Manager can also help disable network-draining apps that launch at boot.

5\. Disable Unnecessary Background Apps

Beginner-friendly tip:

\- Press Ctrl+Shift+Esc to open Task Manager. - Review the Processes tab for programs using network resources and close those you don’t need.

Advanced tip:

\- Navigate to the Startup tab in Task Manager or use Glary Utilities’ Startup Manager to prevent non-essential applications from launching with Windows.

6\. Adjust Windows Network Settings for Maximum Throughput

Beginner-friendly tip:

\- Go to Control Panel > Network and Internet > Network and Sharing Center > Change adapter settings. - Right-click your network connection, select Properties > Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) > Properties. - Set “Obtain DNS server address automatically” if you’re unsure what DNS servers you’re using.

Advanced tip:

\- Manually enter public DNS servers (like Google’s 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4) for potentially faster DNS resolution. - Use Command Prompt (as Admin) to run: netsh interface tcp set global autotuninglevel=normal This ensures optimal TCP receive window scaling.

7\. Turn Off Large System Updates During Peak Usage

Beginner-friendly tip:

\- Schedule Windows Updates for off-peak hours to avoid slowdowns during gaming or work. - Go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update > Change active hours.

Advanced tip:

\- On Windows Pro editions, use Group Policy Editor to control update download and installation times precisely.

8\. Enable QoS (Quality of Service) Where Available

Beginner-friendly tip:

\- Many modern routers offer QoS features. Access your router’s admin panel (usually by typing 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1 in a browser). - Prioritize applications or devices that need the most bandwidth, such as your work laptop or game console.

Advanced tip:

\- On Windows Pro, use Local Group Policy Editor to set policies for reserving bandwidth for specific services.

9\. Scan for Malware or Network Hijackers

Beginner-friendly tip:

\- Malware can slow down your network. Use Windows Security or a trusted antivirus to perform a full scan.

Glary Utilities recommendation:

\- [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com)’ Malware Remover can supplement your antivirus to catch potentially unwanted programs affecting your network.

10\. Monitor and Test Your Network Speed

Beginner-friendly tip:

\- Use online tools like Speedtest.net to check your real-world internet speed. - Compare results on different devices and locations in your home to identify weak spots.

Advanced tip:

\- Use Windows Resource Monitor (type resmon in the Start Menu) to see which processes use the most bandwidth. - Use [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com)’ Network Monitor tool for an easy overview of active network connections and traffic.
