The Windows Command Line Interface (CLI) is a powerful tool that many users often overlook. It offers a range of system tools that can significantly enhance your system's performance and streamline maintenance tasks. This guide will introduce you to some essential command line tools and provide practical steps to use them effectively.

1\. Accessing the Command Line Interface

To start using the command line, you need to access the Command Prompt: - Press the Windows key + R to open the Run dialog box. - Type "cmd" and press Enter.

You can also search for "cmd" in the Start menu and select "Command Prompt" from the results.

2\. Using the System File Checker (sfc)

The System File Checker is a utility that allows you to scan and repair corrupted system files. Here's how to use it: - Open Command Prompt as an administrator by right-clicking on it and selecting "Run as administrator". - Type \`sfc /scannow\` and press Enter. - The tool will start scanning your system for corrupted files and automatically repair them. This process can take several minutes.

3\. Checking Disk Health with CHKDSK

CHKDSK (Check Disk) is used to identify and fix disk errors. To run this command: - In the Command Prompt, type \`chkdsk C: /f /r\` and press Enter. Replace "C:" with the drive letter you want to check. - If the drive is in use, it will ask you to schedule a scan the next time your system restarts. Type "Y" and press Enter.

Restart your computer to let CHKDSK do its job.

4\. Managing Disk Space with Disk Cleanup

Although Disk Cleanup is primarily a graphical tool, you can use it from the command line for automated cleanup tasks: - Type \`cleanmgr /sageset:1\` and press Enter to open a configuration dialog. Select the files you want to delete. - Use \`cleanmgr /sagerun:1\` to execute the cleanup based on your saved settings.

5\. Optimizing System Performance with Task Manager

Task Manager can help you identify processes that may be slowing down your computer. To open it via command line: - Type \`taskmgr\` and press Enter. - Navigate to the "Processes" tab to see which processes consume the most resources. You can end tasks that are non-essential or problematic.

6\. Utilizing Powercfg for Energy Efficiency

Powercfg is a hidden gem for managing power settings and diagnosing power-related issues: - Type \`powercfg /energy\` and press Enter to generate a detailed power efficiency report. - After 60 seconds, it will save a report in the form of an HTML file. Open this file to review suggestions on improving your PC's power consumption.

7\. Leveraging Glary Utilities for Comprehensive Maintenance

While the command line tools mentioned are powerful, using Glary Utilities can provide a more user-friendly experience for system optimization and maintenance: - Install Glary Utilities from their website. - With its 1-Click Maintenance feature, you can quickly scan your system for issues like registry errors, unnecessary files, and shortcuts that need fixing. - Glary Utilities also offers a disk cleaner, startup manager, and more, making it a perfect complement to the command line tools.
