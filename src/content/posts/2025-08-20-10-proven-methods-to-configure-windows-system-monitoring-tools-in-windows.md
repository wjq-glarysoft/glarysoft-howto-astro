Monitoring system performance in Windows is one of the most effective ways to prevent issues, diagnose problems, and optimize your PC for smoother operation. Windows provides several built-in tools for tracking resources such as CPU, memory, disk, and network usage, and there are also third-party utilities that can make the process easier. Below are ten proven methods, explained step by step, to configure and use system monitoring tools in Windows. Sections are structured for both beginners and advanced users.

1\. How to Open and Configure Task Manager (Beginner) Task Manager is the most accessible system monitoring tool in Windows. Step 1: Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to launch Task Manager. Step 2: Click “More details” if only the compact view is visible. Step 3: Go to the “Performance” tab to monitor CPU, Memory, Disk, and Ethernet usage in real time. Step 4: Right-click any graph to change the update speed or select additional views, such as logical processors for CPU monitoring.

This is ideal for tracking immediate performance issues like an app consuming excessive CPU or memory.

2\. How to Use Resource Monitor for Deeper Insights (Beginner to Intermediate) Resource Monitor expands on Task Manager with more in-depth views. Step 1: Open the Start menu, type Resource Monitor, and press Enter. Step 2: Navigate across tabs such as CPU, Memory, Disk, and Network. Step 3: Expand the sections to view which processes are consuming specific resources. Step 4: Right-click a process to suspend or end it, or to search online for more details.

Resource Monitor is particularly effective for troubleshooting slowdowns caused by disk or network usage.

3\. How to Configure Performance Monitor Counters (Intermediate) Performance Monitor provides detailed statistics that can be logged over time. Step 1: Open the Start menu, type perfmon, and press Enter. Step 2: In the left panel, select Performance Monitor. Step 3: Click the green plus icon to add counters, such as Processor Time, Available MBytes of Memory, or Disk Queue Length. Step 4: Add the counters to track them in real time. Step 5: Right-click on the chart to change graph types or display options.

Experienced users rely on this tool for long-term monitoring and trend analysis.

4\. How to Create Data Collector Sets in Performance Monitor (Advanced) Data Collector Sets capture performance logs automatically. Step 1: In Performance Monitor, expand Data Collector Sets. Step 2: Right-click User Defined and select New > Data Collector Set. Step 3: Choose Create Manually and select Performance Counters. Step 4: Add relevant counters, set a sample interval, and choose a storage location. Step 5: Start the Data Collector Set and allow it to log system activity over time.

This method is best for diagnosing intermittent performance problems.

5\. How to Use Event Viewer for System Monitoring (Intermediate) Event Viewer is essential for monitoring system events, warnings, and errors. Step 1: Open the Start menu, type Event Viewer, and press Enter. Step 2: In the left panel, expand Windows Logs. Step 3: Select System or Application to review events. Step 4: Use the Filter Current Log option to focus on warnings or critical errors. Step 5: Double-click an event to read detailed information and determine the cause of crashes or instability.

6\. How to Configure Reliability Monitor for Stability Tracking (Beginner) Reliability Monitor provides a clear timeline of system stability. Step 1: Open the Start menu, type Reliability Monitor, and press Enter. Step 2: Review the stability index graph. Step 3: Click on any date to view system warnings, software installs, updates, or critical system failures. Step 4: Use this data to identify if new software or updates are linked to instability.

7\. How to Set Up Alerts in Performance Monitor (Advanced) Performance Monitor allows alerts when certain conditions are met. Step 1: In Performance Monitor, expand Data Collector Sets. Step 2: Right-click User Defined and select New > Data Collector Set. Step 3: Choose Create Manually and select Alerts. Step 4: Add counters (for example, Processor Time). Step 5: Define thresholds, such as CPU usage exceeding 90%. Step 6: Configure Task Scheduler actions to run when the alert is triggered.

This setup is perfect for system administrators monitoring server environments.

8\. How to Monitor Startup Programs with Task Manager (Beginner) Startup programs can greatly affect performance. Step 1: Open Task Manager by pressing Ctrl + Shift + Esc. Step 2: Go to the Startup tab. Step 3: Review the list of programs and their startup impact. Step 4: Right-click unnecessary programs and select Disable to prevent them from launching at startup.

9\. How to Use [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) for Comprehensive Monitoring and Cleanup (Beginner to Advanced) Glary Utilities is a third-party optimization suite that extends built-in Windows tools. Step 1: Install and open [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com). Step 2: Navigate to the “1-Click Maintenance” tab to quickly identify registry errors, temp files, and startup issues. Step 3: Use the “Performance Monitor” widget to track CPU, RAM, and disk usage from the desktop. Step 4: Open the “Startup Manager” within Glary Utilities for deeper control over startup processes. Step 5: Access the “Disk Cleaner” and “Registry Repair” tools to remove unnecessary clutter and improve monitoring accuracy by reducing noise from junk data.

Glary Utilities is particularly helpful for users who want both monitoring and optimization tools in one package, without juggling multiple built-in utilities.

10\. How to Schedule Automatic System Maintenance (Intermediate) Windows includes scheduled maintenance to optimize performance. Step 1: Open Control Panel and select Security and Maintenance. Step 2: Expand the Maintenance section. Step 3: Under Automatic Maintenance, select Change maintenance settings. Step 4: Choose a daily time for maintenance to run, ensuring the computer is idle and powered on.

This ensures that disk optimization, updates, and diagnostics run automatically, reducing manual monitoring needs.

By configuring and using these ten methods, Windows users at every skill level can gain complete control over their system’s performance and stability. Beginners can start with Task Manager, Reliability Monitor, and [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com), while advanced users can take advantage of Performance Monitor counters, Data Collector Sets, and alert configurations for professional-level monitoring.
