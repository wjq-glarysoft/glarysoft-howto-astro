Optimizing your Windows 10 network performance can feel overwhelming, especially if you’re not familiar with networking concepts or system tweaks. However, with the right guidance, anyone can boost their network speed and reliability. This article will walk you through practical, step-by-step methods to improve your Windows 10 network performance, starting with simple actions for beginners and progressing to advanced tuning for power users. We’ll also show how Glary Utilities can make certain optimization tasks straightforward and efficient.

Why Does Network Performance Matter?

A fast and reliable network connection is crucial for streaming, gaming, downloads, cloud work, and more. Network slowdowns can result from misconfigured settings, outdated drivers, cluttered system files, or unnecessary background processes.

Beginner’s Guide: Quick Wins for Faster Networking

Check Your Hardware Connections

Make sure your Ethernet cables are secure and undamaged. If using Wi-Fi, ensure you’re within close range of your router and free from heavy interference (such as walls or microwaves).

Restart Your Devices

A simple restart of your PC, router, and modem can resolve many temporary glitches that slow down networking.

Update Windows and Network Drivers

\- Press the Windows key, type “Check for updates”, and install any available Windows updates. - For drivers: Right-click Start, select Device Manager, expand Network adapters, right-click your network card, and select Update driver.

Limit Background Apps

Some apps might use network bandwidth in the background. To check and limit them: - Go to Settings > Privacy > Background apps. - Turn off unnecessary background apps.

Clear Network Cache with Glary Utilities

Glary Utilities offers a one-click maintenance feature that helps clean temporary files, clear DNS cache, and optimize system settings. Here’s how: - Open Glary Utilities. - Click on “1-Click Maintenance”. - Ensure “Temporary Files Cleaner” and “Tracks Eraser” are checked. - Run the scan and apply fixes. This often resolves network cache issues that can slow down browsing and downloads.

Run Windows Network Troubleshooter

\- Go to Settings > Update & Security > Troubleshoot > Additional troubleshooters. - Select Internet Connections, then run the troubleshooter.

Intermediate: Tuning Windows for Better Network Performance

Change DNS Servers

The default DNS provided by your ISP might be slow. Using faster, public DNS servers can speed up browsing and sometimes downloads. - Right-click the network icon in the system tray > Open Network & Internet settings > Change adapter options. - Right-click your network connection and select Properties. - Choose Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) > Properties. - Select “Use the following DNS server addresses” and enter: Preferred: 8.8.8.8 Alternate: 8.8.4.4 (Google DNS), or try 1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1 (Cloudflare).

Disable Large Send Offload and Other Advanced NIC Features

Some network interface card (NIC) features can impact certain networks negatively. To tweak these: - Open Device Manager, expand Network adapters, right-click your adapter, choose Properties. - Go to the Advanced tab, find “Large Send Offload”, “TCP Checksum Offload”, and similar settings. - Set these to Disabled (one at a time, testing after each).

Advanced: Power User Network Tuning

Tweak Windows TCP/IP Settings Using Command Prompt

Some advanced users may want to alter TCP parameters for high-speed networking.

\- Open Command Prompt as Administrator. - To view current settings: netsh int tcp show global - To enable TCP Window Auto-Tuning: netsh int tcp set global autotuninglevel=normal - To disable TCP Chimney Offload (which may help on some systems): netsh int tcp set global chimney=disabled

Always test your network speed after each change using speedtest.net or similar services.
