Are you noticing slow performance, error messages, or system instability on your Windows PC? Corrupted or missing system files are a common cause of such issues. While there are advanced techniques to repair system files, this guide will help beginner Windows users understand and apply these solutions step by step. We will also introduce [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) as a user-friendly tool for clean up and repair, making complex fixes more accessible.

What Are System File Corruption Signs?

Before diving into repairs, identify common signs of system file corruption: - Frequent crashes or blue screens - Error messages about missing DLLs - Slow boot times or programs failing to launch - Windows features not functioning correctly

If you notice these symptoms, it's time to check and repair your system files.

How Can You Use Built-in Windows Tools for Repairs?

Windows comes equipped with reliable tools for system file diagnostics and repair. Here's how to use them effectively:

1\. System File Checker (SFC) This built-in tool scans and attempts to repair corrupted system files.

Step-by-step: - Click the Start menu, type “cmd”, then right-click "Command Prompt" and select “Run as administrator”. - In the Command Prompt window, type: sfc /scannow and press Enter. - Wait for the scan to complete. If issues are found, SFC will attempt to fix them automatically. - Restart your computer when finished.

Practical Example: If you were unable to open Windows Settings or noticed missing icons, SFC may restore the damaged components.

2\. Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool (DISM) If SFC cannot fix an issue, DISM is your next option.

Step-by-step: - Open Command Prompt as administrator (see above). - Type: DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth and press Enter. - This process may take 10–20 minutes. Wait until it finishes and then restart your PC.

Real-World Scenario: If SFC reports errors it cannot fix, running DISM often resolves deeper problems by repairing the Windows image itself.

3\. System Restore If recent changes have caused issues, you can revert your PC to an earlier state.

Step-by-step: - Type “System Restore” in the Start menu and select "Create a restore point". - Click the “System Restore” button, then follow the on-screen prompts to select a restore point and start the process.

This option is helpful if file corruption began after a recent update or software installation.
