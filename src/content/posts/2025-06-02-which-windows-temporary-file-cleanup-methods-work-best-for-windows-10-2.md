Windows 10 computers generate temporary files during regular use—from system updates to browsing the web, installations, and everyday app usage. Over time, these files accumulate and contribute to wasted storage, slower performance, and occasional glitches. Cleaning up these unwanted files sounds simple, but many users fall into common pitfalls or overlook better alternatives. This article explores the most reliable methods for removing temporary files in Windows 10, highlighting what to avoid and which approaches deliver the best results for both beginners and advanced users.

Why Should You Remove Temporary Files in Windows 10?

Temporary files are intended for short-term use. When they pile up, they not only occupy valuable disk space but can also interfere with system processes, cause software issues, or slow down your PC. Regular cleanup keeps your system running smoothly, frees up space, and can prevent those little annoyances that crop up from time to time, like failed updates or lagging applications.

Common Mistakes to Avoid When Cleaning Temporary Files

Mistake 1: Deleting Files Manually Without Understanding Their Purpose Going into the Temp folder and deleting everything may seem quick, but it risks removing files still needed by active processes. This can cause programs to crash or system instability.

Mistake 2: Relying Solely on Windows Built-in Tools While Windows Disk Cleanup and Storage Sense are helpful, they sometimes miss advanced or application-specific temporary files. Relying solely on these tools might leave behind a surprising amount of clutter.

Mistake 3: Using Unknown Third-Party Tools Not all cleanup tools are trustworthy. Some third-party utilities may be ineffective or even harmful, leading to more problems than they solve.

Mistake 4: Ignoring Application Caches Browsers, editors, and media players can accumulate their own sets of temporary files that aren’t always removed by a general system cleanup.

Beginner-Friendly Cleanup Methods

1\. Using Windows Settings: Storage Sense Storage Sense is a built-in feature in Windows 10 that can automatically delete temporary files.

Step-by-step: Go to Settings > System > Storage. Turn on Storage Sense, or click "Configure Storage Sense or run it now". Check the boxes for "Delete temporary files that my apps aren’t using". You can run it instantly or let it work automatically.

2\. Disk Cleanup Utility Disk Cleanup has been a staple in Windows for years.

Step-by-step: Type "Disk Cleanup" in the Start menu and select the app. Select the drive you want to clean (usually C:). In the list, select "Temporary files", "Recycle Bin", and other unneeded categories. Click OK, then click "Delete Files".

Tip: Always review what you’re deleting. If you’re not sure, leave it unchecked.

3\. [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com): The All-in-One Solution Glary Utilities offers a user-friendly interface for cleaning up temporary files, registry errors, and more, making it a great choice for beginners.

Step-by-step: Download and install Glary Utilities from the official site. Open the program, and on the main screen, click "1-Click Maintenance". Ensure "Temporary Files Cleaner" is checked, then click "Scan for Issues". Review the results and click "Repair Problems" to safely remove temporary files.

Why recommend Glary Utilities? It targets temporary files from both the system and popular applications, reducing the chance of leaving clutter behind. The process is safe and guided—minimizing risk for less experienced users.

Tips for Beginners: Don’t attempt to delete files from Windows or Program Files folders manually. Avoid using unknown or unverified cleanup tools.

Advanced Methods for Experienced Users

1\. Manual Cleanup via Temp Folders Advanced users may want more control.

Step-by-step: Press Windows + R, type %temp%, and press Enter. Select all files (Ctrl+A) and attempt to delete them. Repeat with C:\\Windows\\Temp.

Caution: Files in use will not delete. Skip these—forcing deletion may cause issues.

2\. Command Line Clean-Up For automation or scripting, run Disk Cleanup with additional parameters.

Open Command Prompt as administrator. Type: cleanmgr /sageset:1 Select the types of files to delete, then save. Type: cleanmgr /sagerun:1 to execute.

3\. Glary Utilities: Advanced Options Beyond the 1-Click function, Glary Utilities includes specialized tools:

Open Glary Utilities and go to "Advanced Tools". Select "Disk Cleaner" for deeper scans, or "Tracks Eraser" for browser and app-specific caches. Set schedules for automated cleanup.

[Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) for advanced users allows customization of what gets cleaned and can be combined with registry cleaning for comprehensive maintenance.

Real-World Example: Combining Methods for Maximum Effect A Windows 10 laptop with 20GB free space dropped to 5GB. The user ran Disk Cleanup and Storage Sense, but only freed 1GB. After running [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com)’ Disk Cleaner and Tracks Eraser, more than 8GB was recovered—thanks to cleaning browser caches, unused app data, and system leftovers missed by the basic tools.

Best Practices for Any Skill Level

Back up important files before performing deep cleanups. Schedule regular cleanups (monthly or quarterly) to prevent buildup. Use a trusted tool like Glary Utilities for safe, comprehensive cleaning. Don’t mix multiple cleanup utilities at the same time—it can cause conflicts.

Conclusion: What Works Best?

The most effective and safest way to clean temporary files in Windows 10 is to combine Windows built-in tools with a reliable third-party utility like Glary Utilities. Beginners should stick to Storage Sense, Disk Cleanup, and Glary’s simple 1-Click Maintenance. Advanced users can leverage manual techniques or Glary’s advanced modules for maximum control. Avoid risky manual deletions and always use reputable software to keep your system clean, stable, and fast.
