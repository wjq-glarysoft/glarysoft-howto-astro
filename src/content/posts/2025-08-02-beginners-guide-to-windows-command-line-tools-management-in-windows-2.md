Windows operating systems come packed with powerful command line tools that can greatly improve system management, troubleshooting, and optimization. While many users prefer the graphical interface, learning to use command line tools can give you faster, more precise control over your PC. This guide will walk you through essential Windows command line utilities, providing practical tips and real-world examples for both beginners and advanced users. We’ll also introduce Glary Utilities as a complementary tool for users who prefer an easy, all-in-one solution.

Why Use Windows Command Line Tools?

Windows command line tools provide direct access to system functions, often allowing you to perform tasks faster or more flexibly than through the graphical interface. System administrators and power users rely on these tools for automation, diagnostics, and in-depth system management. Even beginners can benefit from learning a few key commands.

Beginner Section: Getting Started with the Command Line

What is the Command Prompt?

The Command Prompt (cmd.exe) is a built-in tool that allows you to interact with Windows using text-based commands.

How to Open Command Prompt: 1. Press Windows key + R to open the Run dialog box. 2. Type cmd and press Enter.

You can also search for "Command Prompt" in the Start Menu and right-click to select "Run as administrator" for tasks that need elevated permissions.

Basic Commands Every Beginner Should Know

1\. Checking System Information Command: systeminfo Example: Type systeminfo and press Enter. This displays detailed info about your PC, including OS version, memory, and network adapters.

2\. Viewing Disk Space Command: dir Example: Type dir C:\\ to list the contents of your C: drive.

3\. Checking Network Configuration Command: ipconfig Example: Type ipconfig and press Enter to see your computer’s IP address and network info.

4\. Listing Running Processes Command: tasklist Example: Type tasklist to display all running processes, similar to Task Manager.

5\. Shutting Down or Restarting Command: shutdown Examples: shutdown /s /t 0 to shut down immediately. shutdown /r /t 0 to restart immediately.

Practical Example: Cleaning Temporary Files

While you can use the Disk Cleanup tool, the command line offers a quick way: Type del /q/f/s %TEMP%\\\* and press Enter. This command deletes temporary files, helping free up space.

Tip for Beginners: If you prefer a simpler, graphical approach to cleaning and optimizing your PC, try Glary Utilities. It automates tasks like cleaning temp files, managing startup programs, and fixing registry errors—all with a user-friendly interface.

3\. Monitoring and Managing Services Command: sc query Lists all Windows services and their status. Command: net start / net stop Example: net stop wuauserv to stop the Windows Update service.

4\. Viewing and Managing System Events Command: eventvwr Opens the Event Viewer for advanced troubleshooting.
