When it comes to keeping your Windows PC running at peak performance, command line tools are some of the most powerful resources at your disposal. Windows 10 and Windows 11 both come equipped with a suite of command line utilities that can diagnose issues, clear out clutter, and optimize various aspects of your system. Whether you’re a beginner just starting with the Command Prompt, or an advanced user looking to automate complex workflows, this guide will help you harness these tools like a pro.

What Are Windows Command Line Tools and Why Use Them?

Windows command line tools are built-in utilities that you run from the Command Prompt (cmd.exe) or Windows PowerShell. They give you direct control over system settings, disk maintenance, file management, and much more—often delivering more options than their graphical counterparts. Using these tools allows for faster, more precise adjustments, and can automate repetitive tasks.

Beginner-Friendly Command Line Tools for Cleaning Windows

If you’re new to command line utilities, start with these essential tools to clean and maintain your PC:

Disk Cleanup (cleanmgr)

Disk Cleanup is a familiar tool in Windows, but it can also be run from the command line for greater flexibility.

How to use: 1. Press Windows + R, type cmd, and press Enter. 2. Type cleanmgr /sageset:1 and press Enter. 3. In the dialog, select which files to clean (e.g., Temporary files, Windows Update Cleanup). 4. Now type cleanmgr /sagerun:1 and press Enter.

You can automate this process by scheduling these commands with Task Scheduler, ensuring regular cleanup without manual intervention.

System File Checker (sfc)

Sometimes, system performance suffers due to corrupted files. The System File Checker scans for and repairs such files.

How to use: 1. Open Command Prompt as Administrator. 2. Type sfc /scannow and press Enter. 3. Wait for the scan to complete and follow any on-screen instructions.

DISM (Deployment Image Servicing and Management)

If SFC can’t repair issues, DISM often can. It checks for corruption in the Windows image itself.

How to use: 1. Open Command Prompt as Administrator. 2. Type DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth and press Enter. 3. Wait for the process to finish.

Advanced Command Line Techniques for System Maintenance

Once you’re comfortable with the basics, these advanced techniques unlock even more powerful ways to manage your system:

Automate Cleanup with Batch Files

Rather than running commands manually every time, you can create batch files. For example, create a file called CleanPC.bat with the following content:

cleanmgr /sagerun:1 sfc /scannow

Double-clicking this batch file will execute both commands in sequence.

Using PowerShell for Deep Cleaning

For more advanced automation and control, PowerShell is a better choice than Command Prompt.

Example: Remove all files from the temp directory for all users:

Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\\Users\\\*\\AppData\\Local\\Temp" -Recurse | Remove-Item -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

You can further combine PowerShell scripts with Task Scheduler to run them at user logon or system idle times.

Managing Startup Programs with WMIC

Unnecessary startup programs can slow down boot times. Use WMIC to list or remove startup entries.

How to use: 1. Open Command Prompt as Administrator. 2. List startup programs: wmic startup get caption,command 3. To remove an entry, you’ll need to do this via the Registry, but listing them here lets you identify unnecessary items quickly.
