Maintaining the integrity of your system files is crucial for ensuring that your Windows PC runs smoothly and efficiently. Corrupted or missing system files can lead to various issues, including system crashes, application errors, and a decrease in performance. In this article, we’ll explore five essential techniques for repairing system files, with step-by-step instructions suitable for both beginners and advanced users.

1\. How to Use the System File Checker (SFC) Tool?

For Beginners: The System File Checker is a built-in Windows utility that can scan and restore corrupt system files. Here’s how to use it:

\- Press the Windows key, type "cmd" in the search bar, right-click on "Command Prompt," and select "Run as administrator." - In the Command Prompt window, type "sfc /scannow" and press Enter. - The tool will scan your protected system files and replace any corrupted files it finds with a cached copy located in a compressed folder at %WinDir%\\System32\\dllcache. - Wait for the process to complete. Once done, you'll see a message indicating the results of the scan.

For Advanced Users: Advanced users can run the SFC tool in Safe Mode to prevent interference from other applications or processes. Boot your PC into Safe Mode by restarting and pressing F8 before Windows starts. Then, proceed with the same steps as above.

2\. How to Use the Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool (DISM)?

For Beginners: DISM is another command-line tool that can be used to fix Windows Update problems, which might indirectly affect system file integrity:

\- Open Command Prompt as an administrator. - Type "DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth" and press Enter. This command checks for corruption without making any changes. - To repair the image, type "DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth" and press Enter. - The process might take a while. Once completed, reboot your system.

For Advanced Users: Advanced users might choose to specify a source for a healthy system image using DISM:

\- Download a fresh Windows image or use installation media. - Use the command "DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /Source:WIM:X:\\Sources\\Install.wim:1 /LimitAccess" to specify a source, where X: is the drive letter of your installation media or image file location.

3\. How to Perform a System Restore?

For Beginners: If recent changes have caused system issues, System Restore can return your PC to a previous state without affecting personal files:

\- Type "System Restore" in the search bar and select "Create a restore point." - In the System Properties window, click on "System Restore." - Follow the prompts to choose a restore point from the list, then click "Next" and "Finish" to start the process. - After the restoration is complete, your system will restart.

4\. How to Repair Windows Startup?

For Beginners: Sometimes, system file issues can prevent Windows from starting properly. The Startup Repair tool can help:

\- Access the Windows Recovery Environment by restarting your PC and pressing F8 or Shift + F8 during boot. - Select "Troubleshoot," then "Advanced options," and choose "Startup Repair." - Windows will attempt to diagnose and fix startup issues automatically.

For Advanced Users: Advanced users can use the Command Prompt within the Windows Recovery Environment to repair the boot sector with the following commands:

\- Type "bootrec /fixmbr" to fix the Master Boot Record. - Type "bootrec /fixboot" to write a new boot sector. - Type "bootrec /rebuildbcd" to rebuild the Boot Configuration Data.

5\. How to Use Third-Party Tools like Glary Utilities?
