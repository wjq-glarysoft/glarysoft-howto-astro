Are you experiencing strange errors, frequent system crashes, or performance slowdowns on your Windows PC? Often, these issues are caused by corrupted or missing system files. Luckily, you don’t need to be a computer expert to repair these problems. This guide will show you beginner-friendly system file repair techniques using free software, practical steps, and real-world examples—so you can get your Windows computer running smoothly again.

Why Do System Files Get Corrupted?

System files can become damaged due to unexpected shutdowns, malware, failed updates, or hardware problems. When this happens, Windows may not work correctly, and you might see error messages like “Windows resource protection found corrupt files”, or notice that programs won’t open as they should.

How Can You Identify System File Issues?

Common signs of system file problems include: - Programs crashing or refusing to start - Windows features not working (like search or updates) - Slow startup or shutdown - Frequent error messages

If you notice these problems, it’s a good idea to repair your system files.

What Free Tools Can Help With System File Repair?

There are built-in Windows tools and third-party utilities that make the repair process easy, even for beginners. Two of the most effective free solutions are:

1\. Windows System File Checker (SFC) 2. Glary Utilities (Free Edition)

Let’s walk through using both.

How Do You Use Windows System File Checker (SFC)?

SFC is a built-in Windows tool that scans your system for corrupted or missing files and automatically repairs them. Here’s how to use it:

1\. Click the Start button, type “cmd” in the search box. 2. Right-click “Command Prompt” and select “Run as administrator”. 3. In the black window that appears, type: sfc /scannow

4\. Press Enter and wait for the scan to complete. This may take 10-20 minutes. 5. When finished, Windows will tell you if it found and fixed problems.

Real-world example: After running SFC, a user reported that their Start menu began working again and error messages disappeared.

What If SFC Can’t Fix the Problem?

Sometimes SFC can’t repair all files. In that case, Windows offers another tool called DISM (Deployment Image Servicing and Management). For beginners, this is a simple extra step:

1\. Open Command Prompt as described above. 2. Type:

DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth

3\. Press Enter and wait for the process to complete (this can take longer). 4. When finished, run “sfc /scannow” again to check for remaining issues.

Can Glary Utilities Help Repair System Files and Clean Up Windows?

[Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) is a free, beginner-friendly software suite that goes beyond basic repairs. It includes tools to clean, fix, and optimize your PC, making it an excellent choice for users who want a simple interface.

How to Use Glary Utilities for System File Repair and Cleanup:

1\. Download Glary Utilities Free Edition from the official website. 2. Install and open the program. 3. Click the “1-Click Maintenance” tab. 4. Select options such as “Registry Cleaner” and “Shortcuts Fixer”, then click “Scan for Issues”. 5. Once the scan finishes, review the findings and click “Repair Problems”.

Bonus: [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) also offers a “File Repair” tool under the “Advanced Tools” tab. This tool helps repair damaged files and fix errors that SFC or DISM may not catch.

Real-world example: New users found that, after running Glary Utilities, their PC started faster, random error pop-ups disappeared, and overall performance improved.

What Maintenance Tips Prevent Future File Problems?
