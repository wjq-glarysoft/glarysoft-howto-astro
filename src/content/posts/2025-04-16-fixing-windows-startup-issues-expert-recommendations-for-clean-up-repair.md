Windows startup issues can be frustrating, especially when your PC fails to boot properly. These problems can arise from corrupted system files, malicious software, or unnecessary startup programs. As an expert in Windows system maintenance, I will guide you through practical solutions to fix common startup issues, emphasizing clean-up and repair strategies.

1\. Safe Mode Boot

Start by booting your computer in Safe Mode. This diagnostic mode loads minimal drivers and services, allowing you to troubleshoot without interference from third-party software. To enter Safe Mode, restart your PC and press F8 repeatedly before the Windows logo appears. Select "Safe Mode" from the list of options.

2\. Disable Startup Programs

Excessive startup programs can slow down your boot time or cause conflicts. Use the Task Manager to manage these programs: - Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager. - Navigate to the "Startup" tab. - Review the list of programs and disable any unnecessary ones by selecting them and clicking "Disable."

3\. System File Checker (SFC) and DISM Scan

Corrupted system files can lead to startup problems. Use the built-in System File Checker to scan and repair these files: - In Safe Mode, open Command Prompt as an administrator. - Type \`sfc /scannow\` and press Enter. - Wait for the scan to complete, then restart your PC.

If issues persist, use the Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool (DISM): - Open Command Prompt as an administrator. - Execute the following commands in sequence: - \`DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth\` - \`DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth\` - \`DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth\` - Restart your computer after the process finishes.

4\. Uninstall Recently Installed Software

If startup issues began after installing new software, the application might be causing the problem. Remove it to test if it resolves the issue: - Go to Control Panel > Programs > Programs and Features. - Find the recently installed software, select it, and click "Uninstall." - Follow the prompts to complete the uninstallation.

5\. Use Glary Utilities for Comprehensive Clean Up & Repair

Glary Utilities offers a robust suite of tools to streamline the cleanup and repair process. Here's how it can help resolve startup issues: - Download and install Glary Utilities from the official website. - Launch the program and navigate to the "1-Click Maintenance" tab. - Run a comprehensive scan that includes registry repair, shortcut fixing, and system junk removal. - Use the "Startup Manager" feature to efficiently manage and disable unnecessary startup programs with ease.

Glary Utilities provides a user-friendly interface, making these tasks accessible even to non-technical users.

6\. Check for Malware

Malware can disrupt normal startup processes. Ensure your antivirus software is up-to-date and perform a full system scan. Consider using Windows Defender or third-party antivirus programs to remove any potential threats.

7\. Restore System to a Previous Point

If the above steps do not resolve the issue, consider restoring your system to a previous working state: - Type "System Restore" in the Windows search bar and select it. - Follow the prompts to choose a restore point before the startup issues began. - Complete the restoration process and allow your system to reboot.

8\. Consult Professional Repair Services

If you've exhausted these options without success, it might be time to consult professional repair services. They can diagnose and fix more complex hardware or software issues.

By applying these expert recommendations, you can effectively address and resolve Windows startup issues, ensuring your PC operates smoothly. Regular maintenance with tools like Glary Utilities can prevent future problems, keeping your system optimized and reliable.
