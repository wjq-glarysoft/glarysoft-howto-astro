This article provides time-saving tips for fixing Windows startup issues, with easy and advanced methods, real-world examples, and recommendations for using Glary Utilities to streamline the process.

1\. Use Windows Startup Repair

Beginner Tip:

When Windows fails to start, use the built-in Startup Repair tool. It automatically scans for and tries to fix startup problems like missing or corrupt system files.

Advanced Tip:

For deeper troubleshooting, access the Command Prompt from recovery options and run: bootrec /fixmbr bootrec /fixboot bootrec /scanos bootrec /rebuildbcd

These commands repair the boot sector and rebuild the boot configuration data.
