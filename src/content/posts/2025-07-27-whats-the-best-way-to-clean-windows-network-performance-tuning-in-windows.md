If your Windows PC seems slow when browsing the web, downloading files, or streaming video, you might benefit from network performance tuning. Optimizing your network settings can make a noticeable difference in speed and reliability, especially if you share your connection with other devices or use demanding applications. This guide will walk you through practical steps—ranging from beginner-friendly tweaks to advanced configurations—to help you clean up and optimize your Windows network performance.

Why Does Network Performance Matter?

A fast, stable network connection is crucial for everything from remote work to online gaming. Windows, by default, uses general settings that might not be ideal for your specific network or usage style. By tuning these settings and addressing unnecessary background activities, you can experience smoother internet use and fewer interruptions.

Beginner’s Guide: Essential Steps for Anyone

Start with Simple Fixes

1\. Restart Your Router and PC A simple restart of your router and Windows PC can often resolve temporary slowdowns.

2\. Check for Windows Updates An up-to-date system ensures optimal performance and security. - Open Settings - Go to Update & Security - Click Check for updates

3\. Remove Unnecessary Startup Programs Too many background apps can use your bandwidth. - Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager - Go to the Startup tab - Disable apps you don’t need at startup

4\. Use Glary Utilities to Clean and Optimize Glary Utilities is an all-in-one optimization tool. It can disable unnecessary startup items, clean junk files, and even improve your network performance by reducing background clutter. - Download and install Glary Utilities - Use the 1-Click Maintenance feature to scan and fix performance issues - Navigate to the Startup Manager to disable apps that auto-launch - Use the Track Eraser to clean browsing and internet traces that may slow down your system

Network Adapter Settings

1\. Check Network Adapter Drivers Updated drivers can improve compatibility and speed. - Right-click Start, select Device Manager - Expand Network adapters - Right-click your adapter, choose Update driver

2\. Switch to Wired Connection (if possible) Ethernet is generally faster and more reliable than Wi-Fi. If your PC is near your router, try connecting with a cable.

Intermediate Steps: Digging a Bit Deeper

1\. Disable Large Send Offload and Other Advanced Features Some advanced network features can interfere with performance, especially on older hardware. - Open Device Manager - Expand Network adapters - Right-click your network adapter, select Properties - Go to the Advanced tab - Set Large Send Offload (IPv4 and IPv6) to Disabled - Repeat for other features like TCP Checksum Offload if you experience issues

2\. Change DNS Servers Default DNS servers from your ISP may be slow. Consider using Google DNS (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4) or Cloudflare (1.1.1.1). - Go to Control Panel > Network and Internet > Network and Sharing Center - Click Change adapter settings - Right-click your connection > Properties - Select Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) > Properties - Use the following DNS server addresses: Preferred: 8.8.8.8 Alternate: 8.8.4.4

2\. Adjust TCP/IP Settings Using PowerShell Experienced users can fine-tune TCP parameters. - Open PowerShell as Administrator - Run: netsh int tcp show global netsh int tcp set global autotuninglevel=normal netsh int tcp set global chimney=enabled

3\. Disable Windows Auto-Tuning Sometimes this feature causes compatibility issues with certain routers. - Open PowerShell as Administrator - Run: netsh interface tcp set global autotuninglevel=disabled
