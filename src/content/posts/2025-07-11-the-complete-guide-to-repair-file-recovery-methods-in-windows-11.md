Losing important files on Windows 11 can be stressful, but there are several reliable repair and recovery methods available. Whether you’ve deleted a file accidentally, experienced corruption due to a crash, or formatted a drive by mistake, this guide will walk you through various approaches to recover and repair your files and folders. We'll discuss beginner-friendly steps as well as advanced techniques for those wanting deeper control over the process.

What Causes File Loss or Corruption in Windows 11?

File loss or corruption can occur due to:

\- Accidental deletion - Disk formatting or partition errors - Virus or malware attacks - Sudden system shutdowns or crashes - File system corruption or bad sectors

Understanding the cause helps determine the most effective recovery method.

File Recovery Basics for Beginners

How do I recover deleted files from the Recycle Bin?

The Recycle Bin is the first place to check if you’ve deleted a file by mistake.

1\. Double-click the Recycle Bin icon on your desktop. 2. Look for your deleted file(s) in the list. 3. Right-click the file and select "Restore" to return it to its original location.

Can I use Windows’ built-in recovery tools?

Yes, Windows 11 offers File History and Previous Versions for basic recovery:

Restoring files using File History:

1\. Open the folder where the lost file was stored. 2. Right-click in the folder and select "Show more options" > "Restore previous versions." 3. Select a version from the list and click "Restore."

Note: File History must have been enabled before the loss occurred.

What if I don’t have backups enabled?

If you didn’t set up File History or System Restore, you’ll need to use third-party tools or advanced methods, which are detailed below.

Advanced Techniques for File Recovery

How can I recover data using Windows File Recovery tool?

Microsoft provides a command-line tool called Windows File Recovery.

1\. Download Windows File Recovery from the Microsoft Store. 2. Launch the tool (run as administrator). 3. Use the following syntax in Command Prompt:

winfr source-drive: destination-folder /mode /switches

For example, to recover files from a formatted D: drive to C:\\Recovered:

winfr D: C:\\Recovered /regular

Refer to the help menu (winfr /?) for advanced filters and recovery modes (Regular, Extensive, Segment).

What about recovering files from corrupted disks?

Try repairing the disk with CHKDSK before attempting file recovery:

1\. Open Command Prompt as administrator. 2. Run:

chkdsk X: /f /r

Replace X: with your drive letter. This attempts to fix errors and recover readable information.

If the disk is still inaccessible, use third-party recovery software that can read raw data sectors.

Which third-party tools are effective for advanced file recovery?

For complex scenarios—like recovering files from formatted or RAW partitions—specialized utilities are more effective. Here are some options:

\- [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com): Includes a File Undelete tool for recovering deleted files from NTFS and FAT drives. It’s straightforward for beginners yet offers depth for advanced users, such as filtering by file type, size, or date. - Recuva: Allows deep scanning and partial recovery from damaged disks. - R-Studio or EaseUS Data Recovery: Advanced tools for professionals, supporting RAID, encrypted drives, and network recovery.

Using Glary Utilities for File Recovery and Repair

Why choose Glary Utilities for file recovery?

Glary Utilities is more than just a cleanup tool; it includes a powerful File Undelete feature that scans drives for recoverable files, even after they’ve been emptied from the Recycle Bin. The interface is beginner-friendly, but advanced users can customize search parameters for more precise results.

How do I recover files using Glary Utilities?

1\. Download and install [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com). 2. Open the program and go to the "Advanced Tools" tab. 3. Click on "File Undelete." 4. Select the drive to scan and click "Search." 5. Preview files and select those you wish to recover. 6. Choose a safe location (preferably not on the same drive) to restore the files.

Real-World Example:

Suppose you deleted a folder on your USB drive and emptied the Recycle Bin. Using Glary Utilities’ File Undelete, you scan the USB drive, locate your files by filtering by file type (e.g., DOCX), and recover them to your desktop.

How can I repair corrupted files after recovery?

Sometimes, recovered files are partially damaged. For documents, use built-in repair tools:

\- Microsoft Office: Open a corrupted file via File > Open > Open and Repair. - For images or videos: Try specialized repair tools (e.g., Stellar Phoenix, or built-in viewers with repair options).

Tips for Advanced Users: Improving Recovery Success

\- Act quickly: Minimize computer use after data loss to avoid overwriting recoverable files. - Use a different drive for recovery: Always restore files to a separate disk or partition to prevent further damage. - Clone failing drives: Use imaging tools like Clonezilla to create a bit-for-bit copy before attempting recovery.

Preventing Future Data Loss: Best Practices

\- Regularly enable and configure File History or similar backup solutions. - Run [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com)’ maintenance routines to keep disks healthy. - Schedule disk checks and monitor SMART status for early warning signs of drive failure.

Conclusion

File loss isn’t always permanent—Windows 11 offers several repair and recovery options, from simple Recycle Bin restores to advanced utilities like Glary Utilities. Beginners can rely on Windows’ built-in features, while advanced users have access to command-line tools and professional-grade software for challenging cases. With the right approach and timely action, you can often recover and repair your files successfully.
