Repairing system files is crucial for maintaining the health and performance of your Windows 10 or 11 PC. Corrupted system files can lead to various issues, including system crashes, slow performance, and unexpected errors. This article provides practical advice on how to repair system files, with methods suitable for both beginners and advanced users. We will also look at how tools like Glary Utilities can simplify these tasks.

For Beginners: 1. What is System File Checker (SFC) and How to Use It? The System File Checker is a built-in Windows utility that scans and repairs corrupted system files. Here’s a simple guide to using SFC:

\- Press Windows + X and select "Windows Terminal (Admin)". - Type \`sfc /scannow\` and press Enter. - The tool will automatically scan and attempt to repair any corrupted files. It’s a good idea to run this when you notice unusual system behavior or errors.

2\. How Do You Use the DISM Tool? Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool (DISM) is another powerful utility for repairing system images and files.

\- Open Windows Terminal as an administrator. - Type \`DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth\` and hit Enter. - This command will check for Windows image errors and attempt to fix them. It may take some time, so ensure your system remains powered during the process.

For Advanced Users: 3. Can You Manually Replace Corrupted Files? If SFC or DISM doesn’t resolve the issue, advanced users can manually replace corrupted files using a known good copy.

\- Identify the corrupted file using the SFC log found in \`C:\\Windows\\Logs\\CBS\\CBS.log\`. - Obtain a clean copy of the file from another working Windows installation or installation media. - Use an administrator command prompt to replace the corrupted file. Ensure you have proper backup before making changes.
