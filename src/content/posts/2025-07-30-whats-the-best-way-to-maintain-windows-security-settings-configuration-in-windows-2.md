Why Is Maintaining Windows Security Settings Important?

Maintaining robust security settings is essential for keeping your Windows PC safe from malware, hackers, data theft, and privacy breaches. Windows provides many built-in tools for securing your device, but regular review and adjustment are key to adapting to new threats and personal preferences. Intermediate users benefit from a deeper understanding of these controls to proactively manage and fine-tune security configurations.

Which Built-In Windows Tools Should You Use?

Windows Security (formerly Windows Defender Security Center) is your first line of defense. It centralizes antivirus, firewall, app, and browser controls. Open it from Settings > Update & Security > Windows Security. Here, check the following:

\- Virus & Threat Protection: Ensure real-time protection is on, schedule quick/full scans, and review recent threats. - Firewall & Network Protection: Confirm the firewall is enabled on all network profiles—Domain, Private, and Public. - App & Browser Control: Use SmartScreen to help guard against malicious downloads and phishing. - Device Security: Check for hardware security features like Secure Boot and TPM.

How to Regularly Audit and Harden Group Policy Settings

For more advanced configuration, the Group Policy Editor (gpedit.msc) allows you to set detailed security parameters. Examples include:

\- Restricting access to Control Panel or specific settings for standard users. - Enforcing password policies (length, complexity, and expiration) under Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Account Policies > Password Policy. - Configuring Windows Defender Antivirus policies for more granular control over scan schedules and exclusions.

Regularly auditing these settings helps ensure no unauthorized changes have occurred. Export and document your security policies for future reference or rapid recovery if settings are reset or lost.

What About User Account and UAC Settings?

Configuring user accounts with least privilege is crucial. Make sure daily-use accounts are Standard, not Administrator. Adjust User Account Control (UAC) settings for maximum prompts to avoid silent elevation of privileges:

1\. Search for “UAC” and select “Change User Account Control settings.” 2. Set the slider to “Always notify.”

This helps prevent malware from making system changes without your awareness.

How Do You Monitor and Log Security Events?

Use the Event Viewer to track security-related events:

\- Open Event Viewer (eventvwr.msc). - Navigate to Windows Logs > Security. - Look for failed logon attempts, privilege use, or unauthorized resource access.

For greater insight, consider enabling advanced auditing policies via Group Policy under Local Policies > Audit Policy.
