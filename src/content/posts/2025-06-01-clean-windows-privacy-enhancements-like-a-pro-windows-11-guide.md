Are you concerned about your digital privacy on Windows 11? Microsoft’s latest operating system offers many privacy and security options, but some settings need a hands-on approach for true control. This guide explores actionable and advanced techniques for intermediate Windows users who want to enhance privacy without sacrificing system functionality.

Why Do Windows Privacy Enhancements Matter?

Windows 11, like its predecessors, collects data to improve user experience and system performance. However, not all data collection is necessary for everyone. Reducing telemetry, limiting app access, and managing online accounts can protect your sensitive information from unnecessary exposure.

Which Built-in Settings Should You Tweak First?

Start by customizing Windows’ built-in privacy controls. Open Settings > Privacy & Security. Here are the crucial sections to review:

1\. Diagnostics & Feedback Set Diagnostic data to “Required only.” This limits the information Microsoft collects about device health and usage.

Turn off “Tailored experiences” and “Send optional diagnostic data” to reduce tracking further.

2\. Activity History Disable “Store my activity history on this device” and “Send my activity history to Microsoft.”

3\. App Permissions Scroll down to “App permissions.” Review each category (Location, Camera, Microphone, Contacts, etc.) and toggle off access for apps that don’t need it. For example, only allow Teams or Zoom to use your microphone and camera.

How Can You Control Telemetry and Background Services?

Windows collects telemetry data in the background. Intermediate users can further minimize this with these methods:

Group Policy Editor (Windows 11 Pro and above) Press Windows + R, type gpedit.msc, and press Enter.

Navigate to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Data Collection and Preview Builds. Double-click “Allow Telemetry,” set to “Enabled,” and select “0 – Security” (minimum data).

Services Management Press Windows + R, type services.msc, and press Enter.

Find “Connected User Experiences and Telemetry.” Right-click > Properties > Startup type: Disabled. Do the same for “Diagnostics Tracking Service” if available.

Note: Disabling some services may affect specific Windows features, like updates or personalized recommendations.

Can You Harden Your Browser Privacy?

Most data leaks occur through browsers. Tweak Edge, Chrome, or Firefox with these steps:

Edge: Go to Settings > Privacy, Search, and Services. Set Tracking Prevention to “Strict.” Disable “Send data about how you use the browser.”

Chrome: Go to Settings > Privacy and Security. Turn off “Make searches and browsing better.”

Firefox: Settings > Privacy & Security > Enhanced Tracking Protection: Strict.

Additionally, clear cookies and site data regularly and consider privacy extensions like uBlock Origin or Privacy Badger.

What About Microsoft Account vs. Local Account?

A Microsoft Account syncs settings and data across devices, but a local account keeps more data on your PC.

To switch: Settings > Accounts > Your info > Sign in with a local account instead.

This method gives you more control, but you’ll lose some sync features.

How Do You Clean Up Digital Footprints and Junk Data?

Unwanted files, logs, and cached data can expose usage patterns. For advanced, regular cleanup and privacy protection, Glary Utilities is a reliable solution.
