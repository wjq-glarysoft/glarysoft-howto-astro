System monitoring tools help you keep track of your Windows computer’s health, performance, and security. However, these tools can themselves be targets for hackers or sources of privacy risk if not properly secured. This guide explains how to protect your Windows system monitoring tools, whether you’re a beginner or an advanced user, using real-world steps you can follow today.

Beginner Section: Getting Started with Safe System Monitoring

What Are System Monitoring Tools in Windows?

System monitoring tools—like Task Manager, Resource Monitor, and third-party apps (for example, Glary Utilities)—show you what’s happening on your PC. They help you view running programs, network activity, disk usage, and more. While helpful, improper use or configuration can create vulnerabilities.

Why Should Beginners Secure Monitoring Tools?

If unauthorized people or malware access your monitoring tools, they could collect sensitive information or change settings to harm your PC. Securing these tools protects your privacy and system stability.

1\. Create Limited User Accounts

Use a standard user account for daily tasks instead of an administrator account. This limits the access that both you and malware have to system tools. - Go to Settings > Accounts > Family & other users. - Add a new user and select “Standard User.” - Use the administrator account only to install trusted software or change system settings.

2\. Keep Your Windows and Tools Updated

Updates often fix security holes in Windows and system tools. - Open Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update. - Click “Check for updates” regularly. - For third-party tools like [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com), use the built-in updater or download only from the official website.

3\. Use Trusted Monitoring Tools Only

Stick with reliable, widely used tools such as Task Manager, Performance Monitor, or Glary Utilities. Avoid downloading monitoring software from unknown websites or suspicious sources.

4\. Protect Access with Passwords

If your monitoring tool offers a password or PIN protection option, enable it. For example, some advanced tools allow you to lock access to their interface.

5\. Enable User Account Control (UAC)

UAC helps prevent unauthorized changes to your system by asking for permission before critical operations. - Type “UAC” in the Start menu and select “Change User Account Control settings.” - Set the level to “Always notify” for the highest security.

6\. Restrict Tool Permissions

Use Group Policy Editor (Windows Pro/Education/Enterprise) to control who can access system monitoring tools. - Press Win+R, type "gpedit.msc," and press Enter. - Navigate to User Configuration > Administrative Templates > System. - Find and configure policies like “Don’t run specified Windows applications” to block access to certain tools for standard users.

7\. Audit Monitoring Tool Activity

Enable auditing to log who uses system tools and when. - Open Local Security Policy (secpol.msc). - Go to Local Policies > Audit Policy. - Enable Object Access auditing to track usage of specific executables. - Review logs in Event Viewer to detect suspicious activity.

8\. Use [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) for Secure Monitoring and Cleanup

Glary Utilities offers a safe, all-in-one system tool suite. It includes features like: - Privacy Cleaner: Removes traces of your activity to prevent snooping. - Process Manager: Shows active processes and allows you to terminate unknown or malicious ones. - Secure File Deletion: Permanently erases sensitive monitoring logs and files.

Steps: - Download Glary Utilities from the official site. - Install and run the program. - Use the “1-Click Maintenance” feature for automated cleanup and privacy protection. - Explore the “Advanced Tools” section for process and startup management.

9\. Set Up Antivirus and Anti-Tamper Protection

A good antivirus scans for malware that targets monitoring tools. Some solutions include tamper protection, which prevents malware from disabling monitoring features or logs. - Ensure Windows Defender or your chosen antivirus is active and up to date. - Enable any “tamper protection” features in your security software settings.

10\. Regularly Backup Configuration and System State

If something goes wrong with your monitoring tools or settings, a backup allows you to restore your PC to a secure state. - Use Windows built-in File History or System Image Backup. - For advanced users, export Group Policy settings or use third-party backup software.
