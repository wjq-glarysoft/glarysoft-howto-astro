When your internet feels sluggish or file transfers crawl across your home or office network, it’s often not your provider’s fault. Windows offers a rich set of built-in tools and settings to help you diagnose, optimize, and improve network performance. This guide walks you through practical steps to boost your Windows network speed, starting from beginner tips and advancing to more technical adjustments. Whether you’re just starting out or looking to squeeze the last bit of efficiency from your setup, there’s something here for you.

What Basic Network Optimizations Should Beginners Try First?

Update Network Drivers Outdated drivers can limit network performance. To update:

1\. Right-click the Start button and select Device Manager. 2. Expand “Network adapters.” 3. Right-click your network adapter and choose “Update driver.” 4. Let Windows search automatically for driver updates.

Switch to Wired Connections While Wi-Fi is convenient, Ethernet cables offer more consistent and faster speeds. If possible, connect your PC directly to your router to see noticeable improvements.

Disable Unnecessary Startup Programs Programs running in the background can consume bandwidth. To manage them:

1\. Press Ctrl+Shift+Esc to open Task Manager. 2. Go to the Startup tab. 3. Right-click unneeded programs and select “Disable.”

Use Windows Network Troubleshooter If you’re experiencing issues, Windows can automatically fix common problems.

1\. Open Settings > Network & Internet > Status. 2. Click “Network troubleshooter” and follow onscreen prompts.

How Can Beginners Use Glary Utilities for Network Performance?

Glary Utilities is a powerful, user-friendly suite that can clean, optimize, and repair your PC, including aspects that affect network performance.

Internet Booster Glary Utilities offers an “Internet Booster” tool that helps you optimize your connection’s settings for greater speed.

1\. Open Glary Utilities. 2. Navigate to Advanced Tools > Internet Booster. 3. Select your connection type and let the tool analyze and recommend changes. 4. Apply the recommended settings and reboot your PC for the changes to take effect.

Network Traffic Monitor Monitoring bandwidth consumption helps you spot which programs are using your connection.

1\. In Glary Utilities, go to Advanced Tools > Network Traffic Monitor. 2. Watch real-time usage and identify bandwidth-hogging applications. 3. Consider disabling or limiting those apps if unnecessary.

Which Intermediate Steps Improve Network Performance?

Disable Large Send Offload (LSO) LSO allows your network adapter to offload large packets, but sometimes it can cause issues.

1\. Go to Device Manager > Network adapters. 2. Right-click your adapter and select Properties. 3. Click the “Advanced” tab. 4. Locate “Large Send Offload” and set it to “Disabled.” 5. Click OK and restart your PC.

Adjust QoS Packet Scheduler Quality of Service settings can prioritize network traffic:

1\. Open Control Panel > Network and Sharing Center > Change adapter settings. 2. Right-click your connection and choose Properties. 3. Ensure “QoS Packet Scheduler” is checked to enable traffic management.

Change DNS Servers Faster DNS can reduce website load times.

1\. Go to Control Panel > Network and Sharing Center > Change adapter settings. 2. Right-click your active connection and choose Properties. 3. Select “Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)” and click Properties. 4. Choose “Use the following DNS server addresses,” and enter fast, reliable servers such as Google DNS (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4). 5. Click OK.

What Advanced Network Tuning Options Are Available?

Tweak Windows Registry for Network Performance Caution: Registry tweaks are advanced and can affect system stability. Always backup your registry before changes.

Increase TCP/IP Connection Limit 1. Press Windows+R, type “regedit,” and press Enter. 2. Navigate to HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Tcpip\\Parameters. 3. Right-click in the right pane and create a new DWORD (32-bit) Value named “TcpNumConnections.” 4. Set its value (decimal) to 500 or as needed.

Enable Receive Side Scaling (RSS) This spreads network traffic processing across multiple CPU cores:

1\. In Device Manager > Network adapters, right-click your adapter and select Properties. 2. Go to the “Advanced” tab. 3. Find “Receive Side Scaling” and make sure it’s enabled.

Use PowerShell for Detailed Diagnosis Advanced users can use PowerShell to check network statistics:

1\. Open PowerShell as Administrator. 2. Type Get-NetAdapterStatistics and press Enter for adapter stats. 3. Use Test-NetConnection -ComputerName google.com for connection diagnostics.

How to Maintain Peak Network Performance Over Time?

Regular Cleaning with [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) Using Glary Utilities regularly ensures your system remains optimized. Running its “1-Click Maintenance” removes junk files and fixes registry errors that can indirectly impact network performance.

Scheduled Reboots Reboot your router and PC periodically to clear network caches and connections for optimal speed.

Monitor and Limit Background Processes Keep an eye on processes using Task Manager or [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com)’ Process Manager to prevent unnecessary background bandwidth use.

Summary

Improving your Windows network performance doesn’t require deep technical skills. By following these steps—updating drivers, managing startup programs, tweaking adapter settings, and leveraging tools like Glary Utilities—you can enjoy a noticeably faster, more reliable network experience. Advanced users can dive deeper with registry tweaks and PowerShell, but every user can benefit from thoughtful optimization and regular maintenance.
