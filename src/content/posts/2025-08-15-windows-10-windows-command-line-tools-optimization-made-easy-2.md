Windows 10 provides a range of built-in command line tools that can help users maintain, troubleshoot, and optimize their systems without relying solely on graphical interfaces. These tools are powerful for both beginners who wish to understand system basics and advanced users who need precise control over system configuration. Used properly, they can improve system stability, performance, and reliability.

Beginner Level: Essential Command Line Tools for Daily Maintenance

For newcomers, the Windows Command Prompt offers straightforward tools that can be used to keep a PC running smoothly.

1\. CHKDSK – Checking Disk Integrity CHKDSK (Check Disk) scans your hard drive for errors and bad sectors. Example: Open Command Prompt as Administrator and type: chkdsk C: /f /r This will scan the C: drive, fix file system errors (/f), and recover readable information from bad sectors (/r).

2\. SFC – System File Checker for Repairing Corrupted Files SFC verifies the integrity of Windows system files and repairs them if needed. Example: sfc /scannow This command scans all protected system files and replaces corrupted copies with the cached version stored locally. Use this if you notice unexplained system crashes or missing features.

3\. IPCONFIG – Network Configuration and Troubleshooting IPCONFIG displays network details and can refresh network settings. Example: ipconfig /flushdns This clears the DNS cache, resolving problems with outdated or incorrect website address lookups.

Advanced Level: Deep Optimization and Diagnostics

For experienced Windows users, command line tools allow more granular optimization and repair.

1\. DISM – Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool DISM can repair the Windows image, particularly useful when SFC fails. Example: DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth This checks the Windows image for corruption and repairs it using Windows Update files.

2\. POWERCFG – Power Management Optimization POWERCFG provides detailed insight into battery and power usage. Example: powercfg /energy This generates a report highlighting power efficiency issues. Run the command, then open the generated HTML report to identify background processes or hardware draining system resources.

3\. NETSTAT – Network Diagnostics NETSTAT helps detect active network connections and troubleshoot unwanted activity. Example: netstat -ano This displays all active connections with process IDs, helping identify suspicious or excessive network usage.

Integrating Glary Utilities for a Complete Optimization Approach

While Windows command line tools allow precise control, combining them with a comprehensive optimization suite like [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) can make system maintenance more efficient. Glary Utilities offers a One-Click Maintenance option that can clean junk files, repair registry issues, optimize startup programs, and free up memory. This complements the targeted fixes from command line tools by providing a broader cleanup and performance boost in a few seconds.

For example, after running SFC and DISM to repair system files, Glary Utilities can be used to remove unnecessary temporary files and optimize disk performance through its Disk Cleaner and Disk Defrag tools. This dual approach ensures not only system integrity but also improved responsiveness.

Practical Example: A Full Optimization Routine

1\. Run CHKDSK to check disk integrity. 2. Use SFC to repair corrupted system files. 3. Use DISM if SFC reports issues it cannot fix. 4. Flush the DNS cache with IPCONFIG to improve network responsiveness. 5. Run POWERCFG to identify and fix power efficiency problems. 6. Open Glary Utilities and perform a One-Click Maintenance to clean temporary files, fix registry errors, and optimize startup programs.

By leveraging both the built-in Windows 10 command line tools and the automation of [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com), users gain a practical, powerful, and efficient optimization strategy that works for both everyday maintenance and advanced troubleshooting. This combination ensures that systems remain fast, stable, and ready for demanding tasks.
