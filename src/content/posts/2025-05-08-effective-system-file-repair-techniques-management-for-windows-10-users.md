Keeping your Windows 10 system in optimal condition often requires addressing file corruption or damage that can occur over time. Intermediate users have several effective techniques at their disposal for repairing system files, ensuring their PC runs smoothly. This article provides a step-by-step guide for managing system file repairs to maintain a healthy Windows environment.

What is the System File Checker (SFC) and How to Use It?

The System File Checker is a built-in Windows utility that scans for and restores corrupted system files. It's a straightforward tool that can be a lifesaver when dealing with minor system issues.

1\. Open the Command Prompt as an Administrator: - Press the Windows key, type "cmd," right-click on "Command Prompt," and select "Run as administrator."

2\. Run the SFC Scan: - In the Command Prompt window, type \`sfc /scannow\` and press Enter. - The tool will start scanning your system files. This process can take several minutes, so be patient.

3\. Review the Results: - Once the scan is complete, SFC will provide a summary. If it detects and repairs files, it will inform you. If it cannot repair some files, it may require further action with the Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool (DISM).

Using DISM to Repair System Image

DISM is a more advanced tool that repairs the system image and can fix issues that SFC cannot.

1\. Open the Command Prompt as Administrator: - Follow the same steps as before to access the Command Prompt with admin rights.

2\. Run the DISM Command: - Type \`DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth\` and press Enter. - This command checks and repairs the Windows image. It can take some time, especially if it needs to download files from Windows Update.

3\. Follow Up with SFC: - After DISM completes its process, run the \`sfc /scannow\` command again to ensure that all issues are resolved.

What to Do if System File Repairs Fail?

If the techniques above don't resolve your issues, here are some additional steps:

\- Perform a System Restore: Use Windows System Restore to revert your system to a previous state before issues occurred.

\- Check for Updates: Ensure your Windows 10 is up-to-date, as Microsoft frequently releases patches that could address underlying problems.

\- Consider a Reset: As a last resort, perform a Windows 10 Reset, which reinstalls the operating system while allowing you to keep or remove personal files.

In conclusion, maintaining your system involves regular checks and repairs of system files. By utilizing tools like SFC, DISM, and Glary Utilities, you can effectively manage and repair your Windows 10 system, ensuring it remains stable and responsive. Remember to regularly back up important data to avoid loss during repair processes.
