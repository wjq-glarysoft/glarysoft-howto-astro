When it comes to maintaining the health and performance of a Windows PC, diagnostic utilities play a crucial role. These tools not only help identify issues but also provide insights into system performance and potential future problems. As an advanced user, leveraging these utilities effectively can significantly enhance your troubleshooting skills and streamline system maintenance.

1\. Utilizing Event Viewer for In-Depth Log Analysis

Event Viewer is a powerful diagnostic tool in Windows that records various system and application events. Advanced users can delve into these logs to pinpoint the exact cause of system crashes, application errors, and other issues.

To access Event Viewer: - Press Win + R, type "eventvwr.msc", and hit Enter. - Navigate through the console tree to explore various logs like Application, Security, and System under Windows Logs.

For example, if an application frequently crashes, you can use Event Viewer to track down the specific error logs. Look for entries with a "Critical" or "Error" level under the Application log to identify the problem. Double-click an entry to view detailed information, including error codes and potential causes.

2\. Deploying Performance Monitor for Real-Time Analysis

Performance Monitor is an essential tool for real-time system analysis and performance tuning. It allows you to track various system metrics such as CPU usage, disk activity, and memory utilization.

To start using Performance Monitor: - Press Win + R, type "perfmon", and press Enter. - Use the Performance Monitor in the left pane to add counters based on your needs. For example, you can track processor time to identify CPU bottlenecks.

By setting up a custom Data Collector Set, you can log data over time to analyze performance trends and identify sporadic issues. This is particularly useful for diagnosing intermittent performance drops.

3\. Leveraging Resource Monitor for Detailed Resource Tracking

Resource Monitor provides a more detailed view of how system resources are being used, offering a granular level of analysis.

To open Resource Monitor: - Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager. - Click on the "Performance" tab and then the "Open Resource Monitor" link at the bottom.

Use Resource Monitor to monitor processes, disk activity, network usage, and memory usage. For instance, if you notice unusual disk activity, you can switch to the Disk tab to see which processes are causing high disk usage and take action accordingly.

4\. Advanced Disk Diagnostics with CHKDSK

CHKDSK is a command-line utility that checks and repairs disk errors. Advanced users can use it to ensure disk integrity and fix file system errors.

To run CHKDSK: - Open Command Prompt as an Administrator. - Type "chkdsk /f" and press Enter. This command checks and fixes errors on the disk. If you need to scan for bad sectors, use "chkdsk /r".

Schedule the CHKDSK operation on the next reboot if prompted, especially if you're scanning the system drive. This ensures that the drive is not in use during the scan and allows CHKDSK to fix errors effectively.

5\. Comprehensive Cleanup and Optimization with Glary Utilities

While Windows provides several native diagnostic tools, third-party solutions like Glary Utilities offer a comprehensive approach to system maintenance and optimization.

Glary Utilities features include: - Disk Cleanup to remove junk files and free up space. - Registry Repair to fix invalid entries and improve system stability. - Startup Manager to optimize boot time by managing startup programs.

To use Glary Utilities effectively: - Download and install Glary Utilities from the official website. - Open the program and navigate to the "1-Click Maintenance" tab to quickly perform a suite of optimization tasks. - Explore specific tools under the "Advanced Tools" tab for more targeted operations like Duplicate Files Finder and Uninstall Manager.

Incorporating these advanced techniques and tools into your regular maintenance routine will ensure your Windows system runs smoothly and efficiently. By mastering these diagnostic utilities, you can address issues proactively and maintain peak performance.
