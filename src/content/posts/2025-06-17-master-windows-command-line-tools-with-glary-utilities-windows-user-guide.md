Are you ready to take your Windows skills to the next level? The command line offers powerful tools for managing, troubleshooting, and optimizing your system. For intermediate users, mastering these tools can streamline your workflow and provide solutions that the graphical interface sometimes can’t. In this guide, we’ll explore essential Windows command line tools and show how Glary Utilities complements or enhances these tasks, providing both depth and simplicity.

Why Use Command Line Tools in Windows?

Command line tools give you direct access to Windows’ underlying functions—great for automation, bulk operations, and tasks that aren’t available through the standard GUI. They let you analyze, repair, and maintain your system with precision. However, some tools require exact syntax and can feel intimidating. That's where Glary Utilities shines as a supportive solution, offering many of these functions through a friendly interface.

Which Command Line Tools Should Intermediate Users Know?

1\. SFC and DISM: System File Checks and Repairs SFC (System File Checker) and DISM (Deployment Image Servicing and Management) are invaluable for diagnosing and repairing corrupted system files.

Example: Open Command Prompt as Administrator and run: sfc /scannow

If issues persist, follow up with: DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth

[Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) Alternative: While SFC and DISM are manual, Glary Utilities’ “Repair System Files” feature provides a one-click solution, making it easier to maintain system integrity without memorizing commands.

2\. CHKDSK: Disk Error Checking CHKDSK scans your drives for file system errors and bad sectors.

Example: To scan your C: drive, enter: chkdsk C: /f /r

This may require a restart to fix issues.

Glary Utilities Alternative: The “Disk Repair” module in Glary Utilities allows you to scan and repair drives from the interface, offering detailed reports and scheduling options for convenience.

3\. TASKLIST and TASKKILL: Manage Running Processes TASKLIST displays all running processes, while TASKKILL stops them.

Example: See all processes: tasklist

End a process: taskkill /IM notepad.exe /F

Glary Utilities Advantage: Glary Utilities’ “Process Manager” gives you a graphical overview with more information and safe termination options, reducing the risk of accidentally ending critical system processes.

4\. IPCONFIG and NETSTAT: Network Diagnostics IPCONFIG reveals your network configuration, and NETSTAT shows active network connections.

Example: Check your IP address: ipconfig

See network connections: netstat -an

Glary Utilities Network Tools: With Glary Utilities, network diagnostics are accessible via “Network Information.” It offers visual summaries of your network status, helping you pinpoint connectivity issues faster.

5\. CLEANMGR and DEL: Cleaning Up Junk Files CLEANMGR launches Disk Cleanup to remove temporary files. The DEL command deletes files from the command line (use with caution).

Example: Launch Disk Cleanup: cleanmgr

Delete all .tmp files in a folder: del C:\\Temp\\\*.tmp

Why Use Glary Utilities for Cleanup? [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com)’ “Disk Cleaner” and “Tracks Eraser” are safer and more comprehensive, finding and removing unnecessary files, browser traces, and registry leftovers—reducing the risk of deleting important data by mistake.

How Can You Combine Command Line Tools with Glary Utilities?

A smart workflow for intermediate users involves using command line tools for quick, specific tasks and Glary Utilities for routine maintenance, automation, and diagnostics. For example:

\- Schedule Glary Utilities’ 1-Click Maintenance to handle cleaning, repairing, and optimizing regularly. - Use command line tools for advanced troubleshooting when you need granular control. - Rely on Glary Utilities’ logs and reports to track what changes have been made, providing a clear audit trail.

Practical Example: Optimizing a Slow PC

1\. Use SFC and DISM to ensure system files are healthy. 2. Run CHKDSK to rule out disk errors. 3. Use [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com)’ “Startup Manager” to disable unnecessary startup programs (or use the command line WMIC tool for advanced options). 4. Clean up junk files with Glary Utilities for a more thorough result than CLEANMGR. 5. Monitor processes with Glary Utilities’ “Process Manager” for a safer, more informative experience.

What Are the Benefits of Using Glary Utilities Alongside Command Line Tools?

\- Simplicity: No need to remember complex syntax for routine tasks. - Safety: Fewer risks of accidental system damage. - Reporting: Easy-to-understand feedback and logs. - Time Savings: Batch operations and automation features save time over manual command entry.

Final Thoughts

Mastering Windows command line tools empowers you to solve problems efficiently. For intermediate Windows users, combining these tools with Glary Utilities creates a balanced approach: use the command line for precision, and rely on Glary Utilities for routine maintenance and enhanced system management. This hybrid strategy keeps your Windows PC running smoothly and lets you tackle issues with confidence.
