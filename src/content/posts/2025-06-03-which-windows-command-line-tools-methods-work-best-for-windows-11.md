Windows 11 has brought a fresh, streamlined look to desktop computing, but underneath the hood, the classic command line still offers powerful ways to diagnose, repair, and optimize your PC. Whether you’re a casual user looking to run basic tasks or an advanced user interested in scripting and automation, understanding the most effective command line tools can save you time and keep your system running at peak performance.

Beginner-Friendly Command Line Tools: Getting Started

What is the Command Prompt and Why Use It?

The Command Prompt (cmd.exe) remains one of the simplest ways to interface directly with Windows. You can launch it by typing "cmd" in the Start menu. It lets you run commands for file management, system information, and troubleshooting.

Key Beginner Commands and Their Uses

ipconfig Check your network configuration. Use ipconfig /all to view detailed adapter settings. Useful for troubleshooting connection issues.

sfc /scannow Run the System File Checker to scan and automatically repair corrupted or missing Windows system files. Step-by-step: 1. Open Command Prompt as Administrator (right-click, select "Run as administrator"). 2. Type sfc /scannow and press Enter. 3. Wait for the scan to complete and follow any prompts.

chkdsk Checks and repairs disk errors. Step-by-step: 1. In Command Prompt, type chkdsk C: /f /r 2. You may be prompted to schedule the check on reboot—press Y and restart your PC.

tasklist and taskkill View all running processes (tasklist) and end a specific task (taskkill /PID \[pid\_number\]). This is helpful when dealing with unresponsive applications.

Where Does Glary Utilities Fit In?

For users who prefer not to use the command prompt, a tool like [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) can automate and simplify many of these maintenance tasks, such as disk cleanup, registry repair, and system optimization, all from an easy-to-navigate interface.

Advanced Techniques: Power for Experienced Users

Using Windows PowerShell

PowerShell is more robust than Command Prompt, with support for scripting and complex automation. Examples:

Get-Process Lists all running processes, similar to tasklist, but with more detail.

Get-Service | Where-Object {$\_.Status -eq "Stopped"} Lists all stopped services. You can restart them with Start-Service \[service name\].

Repair-WindowsImage -Online -RestoreHealth Repairs the Windows image, often more thorough than sfc /scannow.

Automation with Batch Files and Scripts

For repetitive tasks, batch files can save time. Example: Create a file named cleanup.bat with these lines:

@echo off echo Cleaning temporary files... del /q/f/s %TEMP%\\\* echo Done.

Run this as administrator to clean temporary files across user profiles.

Leveraging System Tools for Deep Maintenance

DISM (Deployment Image Servicing and Management) This utility is invaluable for advanced repair tasks:

DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth Checks for corruption in the system image.

DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth Attempts to repair issues automatically.

WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line) Query system information quickly:

wmic diskdrive get status wmic memorychip get capacity

Practical Example: Full System Health Check

1\. Run sfc /scannow to check for file corruption. 2. Run DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth for deeper repairs. 3. Use chkdsk C: /f /r to check the drive. 4. Use PowerShell Get-EventLog -LogName System -Newest 20 to review recent system errors.

For those who want to avoid the manual process or prefer a graphical interface, [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) includes one-click tools for registry cleaning, disk repair, and startup optimization. Its "1-Click Maintenance" feature can handle many of the tasks you’d otherwise script or run individually from the command line.

Command Line Tool Limitations and When to Use Graphical Alternatives

While command line tools are powerful, they require precise input and can be less forgiving of mistakes. Beginners may find graphical solutions like Glary Utilities safer and more convenient, while advanced users can leverage the command line for bulk tasks, scripting, and remote management.

Conclusion

Windows 11 continues to support a wide array of command line tools, from the basic (ipconfig, chkdsk) to the advanced (PowerShell, DISM). Beginners can quickly troubleshoot with a handful of commands, while power users can automate and deeply diagnose their systems. For those wanting the best of both worlds—a comprehensive, safe, and efficient way to optimize and maintain a Windows PC—Glary Utilities is a valuable companion, wrapping the most essential maintenance features in an accessible package. Whether by command line or with a powerful system utility, keeping your Windows 11 system in top shape has never been more achievable.
