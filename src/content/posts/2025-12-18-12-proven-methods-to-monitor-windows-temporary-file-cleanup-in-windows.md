Temporary files in Windows accumulate over time due to software installations, program updates, and daily operations. These files can quickly fill your drive, slowing down your system and reducing available storage space. Monitoring and cleaning these temporary files on a regular basis ensures your PC remains fast and reliable. Below are 12 proven methods, organized with guidance for both beginners and advanced users, to effectively monitor and maintain temporary file cleanup in Windows.

Scheduled tasks ensure systematic cleanup and monitoring of file removal consistency.

5\. Check Temporary File Growth Using File Explorer Properties (Beginner) You can track folder size growth manually. Step 1: Open the %temp% folder.
