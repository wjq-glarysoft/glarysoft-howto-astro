Windows startup issues can be frustrating, leaving users staring at a blank screen, facing endless loading animations, or stuck in infuriating boot loops. Luckily, most startup problems in Windows 10 and 11 can be resolved with systematic troubleshooting and some well-chosen tools. This guide walks you through practical steps and best practices to get your PC back up and running—no matter your experience level.

Why Do Windows Startup Issues Happen?

Startup problems usually stem from corrupt system files, faulty startup programs, hardware failures, or problematic Windows updates. Sometimes, accumulated junk files and registry errors can also disrupt smooth startups. That's why cleanup and repair are essential aspects of preventing and solving these problems.

Section 1: Startup Troubleshooting for Beginners

What Are the First Steps When Windows Won’t Start?

1\. Restart Your Computer It might sound simple, but a full restart (not just waking from sleep) can resolve temporary glitches.

2\. Disconnect External Devices Remove all USB drives, printers, and other peripherals. Sometimes, these devices interfere with the boot process.

3\. Boot Into Safe Mode Safe Mode starts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and services. - Hold Shift and select Restart from the login screen or Start menu. - Navigate to Troubleshoot > Advanced options > Startup Settings > Restart. - Press 4 or F4 to boot into Safe Mode.

If Windows starts normally in Safe Mode, the problem likely involves a driver or startup program.

How Can You Use Glary Utilities for Basic Cleanup?

Glary Utilities is an excellent all-in-one tool for fixing startup issues caused by junk files, registry errors, and unnecessary startup entries.

Step-by-step for beginners:

\- Download and install Glary Utilities from the official website. - Open the program and use the 1-Click Maintenance feature. This scans and fixes disk errors, cleans up junk files, and repairs registry problems. - Go to the ‘Startup Manager’ in [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com). Here, you can disable unneeded startup programs with a single click, which often resolves startup slowdowns and conflicts.

Section 2: Intermediate Troubleshooting Steps

What If Windows Still Won’t Boot Normally?

Use Windows Automatic Repair - After a few failed boot attempts, Windows should launch the Recovery Environment automatically. - Choose Troubleshoot > Advanced Options > Startup Repair. This tool scans for and repairs common startup problems.

Run System File Checker and DISM Corrupt system files can prevent Windows from starting.

\- Open Command Prompt from the Recovery Environment (Troubleshoot > Advanced Options > Command Prompt). - Type: sfc /scannow and press Enter. - If errors persist, run: DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth

Both commands seek and repair corrupt or missing system files.

How Can Advanced Cleanup Help?

Even after startup repair, leftover registry errors or broken shortcuts can hinder startup.

\- Reboot into Safe Mode. - Open Glary Utilities and use the Registry Repair and Shortcut Fixer tools to clean up remaining issues. This ensures your system registry and startup paths are in optimal condition.

Section 3: Advanced Solutions for Persistent Startup Issues

What Can Advanced Users Do When the Problem Remains?

Check for Driver Issues - Use Device Manager (devmgmt.msc) from Safe Mode to check for any device marked with a yellow exclamation mark. - Roll back or uninstall recently updated drivers.

Manage Boot Configuration Data (BCD) - Open Command Prompt from the Recovery Environment. - Run: bootrec /fixmbr - Run: bootrec /fixboot - Run: bootrec /scanos - Run: bootrec /rebuildbcd

These commands rebuild the Windows boot files, often resolving stubborn boot failures.

Restore from a System Restore Point If System Restore is enabled, roll back to a previous restore point: - In the Recovery Environment, go to Troubleshoot > Advanced options > System Restore. - Follow the prompts to restore your system to a known good state.

Section 4: Preventing Future Startup Problems

How Can Regular Cleanup and Maintenance Prevent Startup Issues?

A clean and optimized system is less likely to suffer startup problems. Best practices include:

\- Regularly running Glary Utilities’ 1-Click Maintenance to keep junk files, unnecessary startup entries, and registry errors in check. - Periodically reviewing your startup programs using Glary Utilities’ Startup Manager to disable anything you don’t need. - Installing Windows updates and hardware drivers carefully, always making sure to create restore points before significant changes.

Real-World Example

A user reports their Windows 10 system takes 10 minutes to boot up after installing several third-party apps. By running [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com), disabling unnecessary startup programs, cleaning up junk files, and repairing registry errors, the boot time drops to under one minute—a testament to the power of regular cleanup.
