Privacy is a top concern for many Windows users, especially as Microsoft and third-party apps increasingly collect data to improve services or target advertising. Fortunately, Windows offers a range of privacy controls, and with careful configuration, you can minimize unnecessary data sharing and protect your information. Let’s explore the best practices for enhancing privacy in Windows, tailored for both beginners and advanced users.

Why Is Privacy Important in Windows?

Windows collects diagnostic data, telemetry, and user activity to improve the product and personalize your experience. While some data collection is necessary for system functionality, much of it can be limited or controlled. Protecting your privacy reduces the risk of unwanted data exposure and helps prevent targeted advertising or profiling.

Privacy enhancements also help to safeguard sensitive information if your device is used for work or contains confidential data.

Getting Started: Essential Privacy Settings for All Users

Beginner Section: Easy Steps to Improve Privacy

1\. Use a Local Account When Possible Creating a local user account instead of a Microsoft account means less data is synced to Microsoft servers. To switch: - Open Settings - Go to Accounts > Your Info - Click "Sign in with a local account instead" This step is best for users who do not need OneDrive integration or Microsoft Store apps.

2\. Adjust Privacy Settings in Windows Windows makes it easy to control privacy from the Settings menu: - Go to Settings > Privacy & security - Review each section, such as “General,” “Speech,” “Inking & typing personalization,” “Diagnostics & feedback,” and “Activity history.” - Disable options that allow Windows to collect data about your activities, like “Send optional diagnostic data” and “Let apps use advertising ID.”

3\. Manage App Permissions - Still under Settings > Privacy & security, scroll to App permissions (such as Location, Camera, Microphone). - Turn off access for apps that don’t need these permissions.

4\. Limit Location Tracking - In App permissions, select Location. - Turn off location services or restrict them to specific apps.

5\. Control Background Apps - Navigate to Settings > Apps > Installed apps. - For each app, click on the three dots, then select Advanced options. - Disable "Let this app run in the background" for non-essential apps.

6\. Use Glary Utilities for Additional Privacy Cleanup Glary Utilities offers privacy protection tools like “Tracks Eraser” and “Privacy Cleaner,” which remove browsing history, cookies, and traces of software usage. Open Glary Utilities, select “Privacy & Security,” and use these modules regularly to keep your PC free from privacy leaks.

For Advanced Users: Deep Dive Into Windows Privacy Enhancements

1\. Fine-Tune Telemetry Using Group Policy or Registry Editor Telemetry controls are more granular in Windows Pro and Enterprise: - Press Win+R, type “gpedit.msc,” hit Enter. - Navigate to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Data Collection and Preview Builds. - Set “Allow Telemetry” to “Enabled,” then select “Basic” or “0 - Security” to minimize data collection. Note: Home editions require registry tweaks instead. - Open Registry Editor (regedit). - Go to HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\DataCollection. - Set or create a DWORD (32-bit) value called “AllowTelemetry” and set it to 0.

2\. Harden Edge and Browser Privacy - In Microsoft Edge, go to Settings > Privacy, search, and services. - Set tracking prevention to "Strict." - Block third-party cookies. - Regularly clear browsing data, or use [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com)’ Tracks Eraser to automate the process.

3\. Control Cortana and Online Speech Recognition - Disable Cortana under Settings > Privacy & security > Voice activation and Cortana. - Turn off “Online speech recognition” if you do not use voice features.

4\. Configure Windows Update Delivery Optimization - Go to Settings > Windows Update > Advanced options > Delivery Optimization. - Turn off “Allow downloads from other PCs” to prevent your device from uploading updates to the internet.

5\. Remove Bloatware and Unnecessary Apps - Use PowerShell with administrator rights to remove pre-installed apps: Get-AppxPackage \*appname\* | Remove-AppxPackage Or, use Glary Utilities’ “Uninstall Manager” for a safer, user-friendly approach.

6\. Encrypt Your Device - For confidential data, enable BitLocker (Pro/Enterprise versions). - Go to Settings > Privacy & security > Device encryption, and follow setup instructions.

Best Practices for Ongoing Privacy Maintenance

\- Regularly review privacy settings after Windows feature updates, as some options may reset. - Run [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com)’ Privacy modules weekly to erase digital traces. - Keep your system and apps updated to patch privacy vulnerabilities. - Be cautious with third-party apps requesting extensive permissions.

Conclusion

Configuring Windows privacy enhancements is a valuable investment in your digital security and peace of mind. Beginners can use simple toggles and built-in settings to reduce data collection, while advanced users have the tools to lock down telemetry and system behaviors even further. For ongoing privacy protection, solutions like Glary Utilities provide automated cleaning and privacy management to supplement built-in options. By combining these strategies, you can significantly enhance your privacy and control your Windows experience.
