Windows 10 offers several built-in system information tools, such as System Information (msinfo32), Task Manager, Command Prompt, and PowerShell, which provide valuable insights into your device’s hardware and software configuration. While these tools are extremely helpful for troubleshooting and optimization, they also pose a security risk if accessed by unauthorized individuals. This article provides expert guidance and practical steps to secure your Windows system information tools, tailored for both beginners and advanced users.

Why Secure Windows System Information Tools?

System information tools can reveal sensitive data such as installed software, hardware specs, process lists, and network details. If accessed by attackers, these details can be used to exploit vulnerabilities or plan targeted attacks. Securing these tools not only protects your privacy but also strengthens your computer’s overall security posture.

Beginner’s Steps: Essential Security Actions

1\. Use Strong User Account Passwords

Set a strong, unique password for your Windows user account. This is the first line of defense to prevent unauthorized access to your system and its tools.

How to do it: - Open Settings > Accounts > Sign-in options. - Choose Password and click Change. - Follow the prompts to set a new, complex password (mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols).

2\. Limit Use of Administrator Accounts

Running your daily activities under a standard user account helps prevent accidental or malicious changes to system settings and tools.

How to do it: - Go to Settings > Accounts > Family & other users. - Check your account type and create a standard account for daily use if needed.

3\. Keep Windows Updated

Regular updates patch security vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit via system tools.

How to do it: - Open Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update. - Click "Check for updates" and install all available updates.

4\. Use Glary Utilities for Privacy Protection

Glary Utilities offers robust privacy features, such as secure file shredding, privacy cleaner, and traces eraser. These tools help remove sensitive traces from your computer, including logs and histories that could be accessed via system tools.

How to use Glary Utilities: - Install and open Glary Utilities. - Navigate to the "Privacy & Security" module. - Run "Tracks Eraser" and "File Shredder" regularly to clean up sensitive data.

Intermediate and Advanced Users: Enhanced Security Practices

5\. Restrict Access to System Tools via Group Policy

Advanced users can use the Local Group Policy Editor to limit access to tools like Task Manager and Command Prompt across user accounts.

How to do it: - Press Win+R, type gpedit.msc, and hit Enter. - Navigate to User Configuration > Administrative Templates > System. - Find entries like "Prevent access to the command prompt" or "Remove Task Manager" and enable them as needed.

6\. Configure User Account Control (UAC) Strictly

UAC helps prevent unauthorized changes to system settings and tools by prompting for administrator approval.

How to do it: - Open Control Panel > User Accounts > Change User Account Control settings. - Move the slider to "Always notify" for maximum protection.

7\. Audit System Tool Access with Windows Event Viewer

Monitor and review access to system information tools to detect unauthorized or suspicious activity.

How to do it: - Open Event Viewer (Win+X > Event Viewer). - Navigate to Windows Logs > Security. - Look for events related to process creation (Event ID 4688) that mention tools like cmd.exe, msinfo32.exe, or taskmgr.exe.

8\. Encrypt Sensitive Files and Folders

Encrypt crucial files and folders that might be viewed or edited through system tools.

How to do it: - Right-click on the file or folder, select Properties. - Click the Advanced button, then check "Encrypt contents to secure data".

9\. Limit Remote Access Capabilities

Disable or restrict features like Remote Desktop and Remote Assistance to prevent attackers from accessing system information tools remotely.

How to do it: - Go to Settings > System > Remote Desktop. - Toggle "Enable Remote Desktop" to Off.

10\. Employ Third-Party System Tool Management

Consider using [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com)’ "Process Manager" and "Startup Manager" to control which processes and startup programs have access to system resources. This helps in keeping only trusted processes running, reducing the risk of malicious tool usage.

How to use [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com): - Open Glary Utilities. - Go to "Advanced Tools" and select "Process Manager" or "Startup Manager". - Review, disable, or remove suspicious entries.

Real-World Example

Imagine your work laptop is lost or stolen. If the thief gains access to system information tools, they could see your installed software (potentially including VPNs or proprietary applications), network configurations, and running processes. These details could be leveraged for further attacks against you or your organization. By following the steps above, including encrypting sensitive files, limiting tool access, and using privacy cleaners like those in [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com), the risk is greatly reduced.

Conclusion

Securing Windows system information tools is essential for both home and professional users. By following these top 10 recommendations, you can effectively reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your personal and organizational data. Beginners should focus on basic account and privacy settings, while advanced users can leverage group policies, auditing, and powerful utilities like Glary Utilities for robust protection. Always stay vigilant and regularly review your system’s security posture to keep your information safe.
