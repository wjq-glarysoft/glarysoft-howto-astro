Windows command line tools offer a powerful way to manage, troubleshoot, and optimize your PC with speed and precision. While graphical interfaces are user-friendly, command line utilities provide deeper system control and automation capabilities valued by both casual users and IT professionals. This article delivers an expert guide to the essential Windows command line tools every user should know, paired with practical advice and real-world examples.

To open either, press Windows Key + R, type "cmd" or "powershell", and press Enter.
