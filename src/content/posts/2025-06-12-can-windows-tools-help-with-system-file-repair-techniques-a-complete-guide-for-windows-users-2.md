Windows operating systems are incredibly robust, but over time, system files can become corrupted or go missing due to software conflicts, faulty updates, malware infections, or unexpected shutdowns. These issues can lead to slow performance, system errors, frequent crashes, or applications failing to launch. The good news? Windows offers several built-in tools and techniques to repair system files and restore your PC to optimal health. In this guide, we’ll break down practical steps for all Windows users, from beginners to advanced, and introduce Glary Utilities as a powerful ally in your repair toolkit.

Why Do System Files Become Corrupted?

Before diving into solutions, it helps to understand the causes. System file corruption commonly occurs because of:

\- Incomplete Windows Updates - Hard drive bad sectors - Malware or virus infections - Sudden power loss or improper shutdowns - Faulty software installations

Knowing the cause can sometimes guide your repair strategy, especially if you suspect a malware infection or a hardware issue.

What Built-in Windows Tools Can Repair System Files?

Several Windows utilities are designed to identify and fix corrupted system files. Here’s an overview of the most reliable tools:

1\. System File Checker (SFC)

SFC scans your Windows system files and attempts to repair or replace corrupted or missing ones.

Step-by-step guide:

a. Open Command Prompt as Administrator: - Press the Windows key, type “cmd”, right-click Command Prompt, and select “Run as administrator.”

b. At the prompt, type: sfc /scannow - Press Enter.

c. Wait for the scan to complete. It may take several minutes. - If issues are found, SFC will attempt repairs automatically. - If SFC cannot fix some files, it will let you know and create a log at C:\\Windows\\Logs\\CBS\\CBS.log for further analysis.

Practical Tip: Run SFC after any noticeable drop in system performance or frequent system errors.

2\. Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool (DISM)

DISM is especially powerful for fixing issues that SFC can’t handle, particularly when the Windows image itself is corrupted.

Step-by-step guide:

a. Open Command Prompt as Administrator.

b. Run the following command: DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth - Press Enter.

c. Wait for the process to complete. This can take 10-30 minutes.

d. After DISM completes, rerun SFC for thorough repair.

Practical Example: If SFC reports errors it can’t fix, DISM often resolves deep-rooted problems, especially after a failed update.

3\. Check Disk (CHKDSK)

CHKDSK checks your hard drive for errors, which can cause system file corruption.

How to use CHKDSK:

a. Open Command Prompt as Administrator.

b. Type: chkdsk C: /f /r - Press Enter.

c. If prompted to schedule the scan at next restart, type Y and press Enter, then reboot your PC.

When Should You Use System Restore?

If system file repairs don’t resolve your issue, a System Restore can roll your PC back to a previous working state.

How to perform a System Restore:

1\. Type “System Restore” in the Windows search bar and select “Create a restore point.” 2. Click the “System Restore” button and follow the prompts. 3. Choose a restore point before the issue began and let Windows complete the process.

Can Third-Party Tools Help with System File Repairs?

Windows tools are powerful, but third-party utilities like [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) can make the cleanup and repair process more accessible and comprehensive. Glary Utilities offers features such as:
