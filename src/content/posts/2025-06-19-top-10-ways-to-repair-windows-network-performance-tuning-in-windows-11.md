Windows 11 offers a modern networking stack, but even advanced users often overlook critical details that can hinder network performance. Tuning your system for optimal throughput and low latency requires more than tweaking obvious settings. Below are the top 10 ways to repair and optimize Windows network performance, emphasizing common mistakes to avoid and practical strategies to ensure you get the most from your network connection.

1\. Are You Using the Latest Network Drivers?

Mistake: Relying on default Windows drivers or outdated manufacturer versions. Action: Visit your network adapter’s manufacturer website and download the latest drivers. While Device Manager can check for updates, it often misses vendor-specific enhancements. For Intel, Killer, or Realtek chips, manual downloads ensure you get the newest optimizations and bug fixes. Outdated drivers can limit bandwidth, cause instability, or fail to support new features like advanced offloading.

2\. Have You Disabled Unnecessary Network Protocols?

Mistake: Letting legacy protocols like IPv6, File and Printer Sharing, or QoS Packet Scheduler run if not needed. Action: Open Network and Sharing Center, click your connection, select Properties, and uncheck protocols not required for your environment. Only disable protocols you’re certain you don’t need. For advanced users in secure or performance-critical setups, this can reduce packet overhead and lower attack surfaces.

3\. Are Background Processes Hogging Bandwidth?

Mistake: Ignoring background services and apps that consume significant bandwidth (Windows Update, OneDrive, or third-party cloud sync). Action: Use Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc) and the Resource Monitor (resmon) to identify processes with high network usage. For fine control, set network usage limits in Settings > Network & Internet > Data Usage, or use Group Policy to restrict Windows Update. Disabling or scheduling heavy sync operations during off-hours can free up bandwidth for priority tasks.

4\. Have You Performed a Thorough Network Cleanup?

Mistake: Allowing accumulated temporary files, outdated cache, and DNS records to slow network operations. Action: Use Glary Utilities to automate cleanup of temporary files, obsolete DNS cache, and browser junk. [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com)’ One-Click Maintenance includes network cleanup modules that target leftover cache and optimize settings for smoother connectivity. Regular use keeps networking components lean and responsive.

5\. Are You Using Optimized TCP Settings?

Mistake: Leaving TCP Auto-Tuning, RFC 1323 scaling, or Chimney Offload at defaults without testing. Action: Open an elevated Command Prompt and use netsh to query and fine-tune TCP settings:

netsh int tcp show global

Adjust settings like Receive Window Auto-Tuning Level or disable TCP Chimney Offload if experiencing issues:

netsh int tcp set global autotuninglevel=normal netsh int tcp set global chimney=disabled

Experiment with these settings, benchmark throughput, and monitor for improvements or regressions.

6\. Is Your Network Adapter Power Saving Holding You Back?

Mistake: Allowing Windows to power down network adapters, causing latency and dropouts. Action: In Device Manager, right-click your network adapter, select Properties, and under Power Management, uncheck “Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power.” Similarly, set the PCI Express > Link State Power Management to Off in Advanced Power Options. This prevents Windows from throttling adapter performance, especially under heavy load.

7\. Are You Overlooking QoS and Group Policy Impact?

Mistake: Misconfigured Quality of Service (QoS) policies can cap bandwidth or cause jitter. Action: Review Group Policy settings (gpedit.msc) under Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Network > QoS Packet Scheduler. Ensure policies like “Limit reservable bandwidth” are set appropriately; the default reservable bandwidth is often misunderstood—set this to 0% if you want all bandwidth available to applications.

8\. Are Faulty Network Profiles Slowing Down Connections?

Mistake: Retaining corrupted or misconfigured network profiles, causing slow or unreliable connections. Action: Open an elevated Command Prompt and run:

netsh wlan show profiles

To delete unused or problematic profiles, use:

netsh wlan delete profile name="ProfileName"

Clearing out old profiles can resolve connection delays and authentication issues, especially after network changes or upgrades.

9\. Have You Tuned for Jumbo Frames and Offloading?

Mistake: Leaving defaults on adapters that support Jumbo Frames, Large Send Offload, or Receive Side Scaling. Action: In Device Manager, access your adapter’s Advanced settings. For gigabit or faster networks, enable Jumbo Frame support (set MTU to 9000, but only if your switch and endpoint devices also support it). Enable or tune offloading features according to your workload—these features reduce CPU load but sometimes cause compatibility issues, so test thoroughly.

10\. Are You Verifying Performance with the Right Tools?

Mistake: Relying solely on “feel” or basic speed tests. Action: Use advanced tools like iPerf3 for throughput benchmarking, Wireshark for packet analysis, and Windows Performance Monitor for in-depth metrics. Compare before and after states to validate that tuning efforts yield measurable gains. Document your baseline and each change to make troubleshooting easier if performance drops.

Bonus: How Can [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) Help with Network Optimization?

Aside from file and registry cleanup, Glary Utilities includes modules to optimize startup items, clean browser plugins, and clear DNS cache. These features help remove networking clutter, reduce software conflicts, and maintain overall system performance. Regular use ensures your networking stack remains agile and responsive without unnecessary background noise.

Conclusion

Advanced Windows 11 network tuning is as much about avoiding common mistakes as it is about applying performance tweaks. By taking a systematic approach—ensuring up-to-date drivers, pruning unnecessary protocols, leveraging proper cleanup tools like [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com), and rigorously testing changes—you can achieve robust, high-performance networking suited to demanding workloads. Always benchmark and document each change to ensure you’re moving toward optimal performance, not away from it.
