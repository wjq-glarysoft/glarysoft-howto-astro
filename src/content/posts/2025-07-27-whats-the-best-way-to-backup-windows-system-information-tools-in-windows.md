Windows comes equipped with several built-in system information tools that provide essential insights into your PC’s hardware, software, and configuration. Tools such as System Information (msinfo32), Device Manager, and System Configuration help users troubleshoot issues and keep track of important system details. Backing up this information is crucial—whether you’re upgrading hardware, reinstalling Windows, or troubleshooting problems.

This guide will walk you through the best methods to backup Windows system information for both beginners and advanced users. We’ll also highlight how tools like Glary Utilities can help streamline these processes and offer additional backup capabilities.

Why Backup Windows System Information?

Backing up system information allows you to: - Restore or reference hardware and software configurations after changes or failures. - Quickly identify previous driver versions or installed components. - Share system details for troubleshooting with technical support.

Beginner Section: Simple Step-by-Step Methods

1\. Using System Information (msinfo32)

System Information (msinfo32) provides a comprehensive overview of your system.

a. Open System Information: - Press Windows key + R to open the Run dialog. - Type msinfo32 and press Enter.

b. Export the Data: - In the System Information window, click File > Export. - Choose a location and name for your backup file (for example, "SystemInfoBackup.nfo" or ".txt"). - Click Save.

This exported file can be opened on any Windows computer using System Information or any text editor, making it easy to reference or share.

2\. Using Device Manager to Backup Driver Details

Device Manager lists all hardware and their drivers. While it doesn’t have a direct “export” option, you can manually collect driver information:

a. Open Device Manager: - Press Windows key + X, then select Device Manager.

b. Take Screenshots or Write Down Details: - Right-click any device, select Properties, and view the Driver tab for version details. - For a comprehensive approach, you can take screenshots or use third-party tools (like Glary Utilities) to generate driver reports.

3\. Using Glary Utilities for Automatic System Information Backup

Glary Utilities is an all-in-one suite that simplifies system maintenance, including the backup of system information.

a. Download and Install Glary Utilities: - Go to the official Glary Utilities website and download the installer. - Complete the installation process.

b. Use the System Information Tool: - Open [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) and select “Advanced Tools.” - Click on “System Information.” - Here, you can view detailed hardware and software information.

c. Export System Information: - Click the “Export” or “Save” option. - Choose the format (HTML, TXT, or XML) and save it to a safe location.

This method saves all critical system information in a convenient, readable format for future reference.

Advanced Section: Command-Line and Scripting Solutions

For advanced users or IT professionals, command-line tools provide flexible backup options.

1\. Using MSINFO32 from the Command Line

You can automate information backup with a simple command:

\- Open Command Prompt as Administrator. - Enter: msinfo32 /report C:\\Backup\\SystemInfoReport.txt

This creates a detailed TXT report at the specified location. You can schedule this command to run regularly using Task Scheduler.

2\. Exporting Drivers with DISM

If you want to back up drivers, use the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool:

\- Open Command Prompt as Administrator. - Enter: dism /online /export-driver /destination:C:\\Backup\\Drivers

This copies all third-party drivers to the backup folder, making restoration easy after a fresh Windows installation.

3\. Using PowerShell Scripts

Advanced users can use PowerShell to export specific system information:

\- List installed software: Get-ItemProperty HKLM:\\Software\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall\\\* | Select-Object DisplayName, DisplayVersion | Export-Csv C:\\Backup\\InstalledPrograms.csv -NoTypeInformation

\- Export event logs: wevtutil qe System /f:text > C:\\Backup\\SystemEventLog.txt

These scripts provide granular control over what information you back up and automate the process.
