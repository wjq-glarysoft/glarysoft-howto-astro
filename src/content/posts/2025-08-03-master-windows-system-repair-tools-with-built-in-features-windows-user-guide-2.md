How Can Built-in Windows Tools Save You Time During System Repair?

Windows comes with a suite of built-in repair tools that can save you hours of troubleshooting and manual cleanup. For intermediate users, knowing which tools to use and when can drastically reduce downtime. Many common issues—like slow performance, unexplained crashes, or startup errors—can often be fixed without resorting to a full system reinstall. The key is to understand what each tool does, how to access them, and the most effective way to use them for quick results.

What Is the Best Order to Use Windows Repair Tools?

To maximize efficiency, always start with the least invasive tool and progress to more powerful options if problems persist. Here’s a practical order you should follow:

1\. Disk Cleanup for Immediate Junk Removal 2. System File Checker (SFC) for Repairing Corrupted Files 3. Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool (DISM) for Advanced Repairs 4. Startup Repair for Boot Issues 5. System Restore for Rolling Back Problems 6. Windows Troubleshooters for Specific Issues

Let’s break down how to use each tool with actionable steps and tips.

How Do You Use Disk Cleanup Effectively?

Disk Cleanup is your first stop for freeing up space and deleting unnecessary files:

1\. Press Windows + S and search for “Disk Cleanup.” 2. Choose your primary drive (usually C:), click OK. 3. Select file types to remove: Temporary files, Recycle Bin, System files, etc. 4. For deeper cleaning, click “Clean up system files.” 5. Click OK and confirm to delete.

Tip: Run Disk Cleanup after large software installations/uninstallations to clear leftovers and speed up disk performance.

Want an even more thorough clean? Glary Utilities offers a more advanced Cleanup & Repair module, scanning deeper for junk files, broken shortcuts, and registry errors in just a few clicks.

How Can System File Checker (SFC) Quickly Fix System Issues?

Corrupted or missing Windows files can trigger crashes or error messages. The SFC tool detects and repairs these files automatically.

1\. Open Command Prompt as Administrator (right-click Start, select “Command Prompt (Admin)”). 2. Type sfc /scannow and hit Enter. 3. Wait for the scan to complete—this can take 10-15 minutes. 4. If issues are found, SFC will attempt repairs instantly.

Tip: Always run SFC after a failed Windows update or if you see repeated error messages about missing system files.

What If SFC Doesn’t Solve the Problem? Use DISM

Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool (DISM) digs even deeper. It fixes the underlying system image, which SFC relies on for repairs.

1\. Open Command Prompt as Administrator. 2. Type DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth and press Enter. 3. Let the tool run to completion. It can sometimes take 20-30 minutes.

Tip: Use DISM if SFC reports errors it cannot fix. After DISM completes, run SFC again to ensure all files are repaired.

How to Resolve Boot Issues with Startup Repair

If your PC won’t boot or gets stuck during startup, Windows Startup Repair can help:

1\. Restart your PC and press F8 or Shift + F8 before Windows starts (for older PCs), or boot from a Windows installation USB/DVD. 2. Select “Repair your computer.” 3. Choose Troubleshoot > Advanced options > Startup Repair. 4. Follow the on-screen instructions.

Tip: Use Startup Repair for sudden boot loops or if you see “Automatic Repair” errors.

Can You Quickly Undo Problems with System Restore?

System Restore is invaluable for quickly undoing problematic updates or driver changes:

1\. Search for “Create a restore point” and select System Restore. 2. Click “System Restore,” then choose a restore point before the issue occurred. 3. Follow prompts to revert system changes.

Tip: Create a restore point before making major changes or installing new drivers.

How Can Troubleshooters Save You from Manual Fixes?

Windows Troubleshooters are designed for quick, targeted fixes. Common troubleshooters include those for Windows Update, Internet connections, and audio playback.

1\. Go to Settings > Update & Security > Troubleshoot. 2. Select the relevant troubleshooter and run it. 3. Follow the on-screen suggestions.

Tip: Use troubleshooters as a first response for specific, isolated issues before diving into more complex repairs.
