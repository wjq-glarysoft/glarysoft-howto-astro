Keeping your Windows PC running smoothly depends on regular maintenance. If key system tools or tasks become corrupted or stop working, you might notice slowdowns, errors, or even crashes. Fortunately, even beginners can use a set of proven methods to repair and restore these essential functions. This guide walks you through simple yet effective steps to fix major Windows maintenance tools, using both built-in options and trusted third-party software like Glary Utilities.

Why Do Windows Maintenance Tools Fail?

Before jumping into repairs, it helps to understand the common reasons why Windows maintenance tools malfunction. Causes include malware infections, unexpected shutdowns, failed updates, or accidental changes to system files. Repairs focus on restoring these tools to their default, working state.

What Are the Key Windows Maintenance Tools?

For beginners, the most important Windows tools to keep healthy are:

\- Disk Cleanup (cleanmgr) - Disk Defragmenter (Optimize Drives) - System File Checker (SFC) - DISM (Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool) - Windows Update - Task Scheduler - System Restore

Let’s go step-by-step to repair and restore each one.

Method 1: Use System File Checker (SFC) to Repair Corrupt System Files

System File Checker is designed to find and fix missing or damaged Windows system files.

1\. Click the Start menu and type "cmd". 2. Right-click on Command Prompt and choose Run as administrator. 3. In the command window, type sfc /scannow and press Enter. 4. Wait for the scan to complete. Follow any instructions provided to fix detected issues.

This process often restores default Windows utilities if they’ve stopped working.

Method 2: Repair Windows Images and Updates with DISM

If SFC doesn’t solve the problem, the DISM tool can repair the system image that SFC relies on.

1\. Open Command Prompt as an administrator. 2. Type DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth and press Enter. 3. The scan may take 10-30 minutes. Do not close the window until it finishes.

After using DISM, run SFC again for a complete repair.

Method 3: Restore Windows Maintenance Tools with System Restore

If a recent problem has disabled a maintenance tool, use System Restore to roll back your system:

1\. Type "System Restore" into the Start menu and open Create a restore point. 2. Click System Restore and follow the prompts. 3. Choose a restore point from before your issue started.

System Restore won’t affect your documents but will revert system files and settings.

Method 4: Fix Disk Cleanup and Disk Defragmenter Issues

If Disk Cleanup or Disk Defragmenter won’t open or crashes:

1\. Open Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc), find any stuck Disk Cleanup or defrag processes, and end them. 2. Restart your PC. 3. Try running the tools again. 4. If problems persist, use SFC or DISM as described above.

Alternatively, you can use [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) to clean your disk and optimize drives safely:

\- Install and open [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com). - Use the "Disk Cleaner" and "Disk Defrag" modules for one-click maintenance.

Method 5: Repair Windows Update Problems

Windows Update is critical for system security and reliability. If it’s stuck or failing:

1\. Run the Windows Update Troubleshooter (Settings -> Update & Security -> Troubleshoot). 2. Restart your PC. 3. If updates still fail, use SFC and DISM to repair system files. 4. Use Glary Utilities’ "Windows Repair" tool to check for and fix common update issues automatically.

Method 6: Restore Task Scheduler Functionality

Task Scheduler automates system maintenance. If scheduled tasks don’t run:

1\. Open Task Scheduler (search for it in the Start menu). 2. Look for error messages next to failed tasks. 3. Right-click a failed task and select Properties. Check that the settings are correct. 4. Use SFC or System Restore if Task Scheduler itself is not launching.

Glary Utilities also provides an easy way to review and manage scheduled tasks under its "Startup Manager" and "Scheduled Tasks" sections.

Method 7: Use [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) for Comprehensive Maintenance and Repair
