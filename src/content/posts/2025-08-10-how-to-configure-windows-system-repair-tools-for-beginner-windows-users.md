Beginner Section: Basic System Repair and Cleanup

How to use Windows built-in repair tools

1\. Using System File Checker (SFC) - Open the Start menu, type “cmd”, right-click on Command Prompt and select “Run as administrator”. - In the black window, type sfc /scannow and hit Enter. - Windows will scan your system files and automatically repair any that are corrupted. This process can take several minutes. - Once completed, restart your computer.

2\. Running the Disk Cleanup tool - Press the Windows key, type “Disk Cleanup”, and open it. - Select the drive you want to clean (usually C:) and click OK. - Disk Cleanup will calculate how much space you can free up. - Check the boxes for the types of files you want to delete (Temporary files, Recycle Bin, etc.), then click OK and confirm deletion.

3\. Using System Restore - Open the Start menu and type “System Restore”. - Click “Create a restore point”, then select the “System Restore” button. - Follow the prompts to select a restore point (a saved snapshot of your system) and restore your computer to a previous working state.
