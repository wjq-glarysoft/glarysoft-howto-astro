Accidentally deleting important files or losing data due to system errors can be a troubling experience for many Windows users. Fortunately, Windows provides several built-in tools and utilities that can help you recover lost or deleted files. In this guide, we’ll walk through various file recovery methods and provide step-by-step instructions suitable for both beginners and advanced users.

What should beginners do first?

1\. Check the Recycle Bin: - Open the Recycle Bin icon on your desktop. - Browse through the files and folders. If you find the files you need, right-click them and select "Restore" to return them to their original location.

2\. Restore Previous Versions: - Navigate to the folder where the lost file was stored. Right-click on it and choose "Restore previous versions." - A list of available previous versions will appear, including those saved as part of a restore point or backup. - Select the version you want to restore and click "Restore."

What if files aren’t in the Recycle Bin?

1\. Use Windows File History: - Go to "Control Panel" > "System and Security" > "File History." - If File History is turned on and configured, you can restore files from there. - Click "Restore personal files," then browse through the backup to locate and restore your files.

2\. Enable System Restore: - Right-click "This PC" and select "Properties." - Click on "System protection" from the left panel. - Ensure that protection is enabled for your drives. If a restore point exists before the file was deleted, you might be able to recover the file by restoring your system.

How can advanced users handle complex recovery tasks?

1\. Use Command Prompt for advanced file recovery: - Open the Command Prompt with administrative privileges by typing "cmd" in the search box and selecting "Run as administrator." - Use the command "chkdsk X: /f" (replace X with the appropriate drive letter) to fix any drive errors that could lead to file recovery. - For advanced recovery, use "Attrib -h -r -s /s /d X:\\\*.\*" to reveal hidden files in a directory, which might include lost files.

2\. Leverage Windows Previous Versions for shadow copies: - Right-click on the folder where files were lost, and select "Properties." - Go to "Previous Versions" tab, and explore shadow copies available in different restore points. - Choose a version before the file deletion and click "Open" to view and recover files selectively.
