Windows includes an impressive array of built-in diagnostic utilities that can help users identify, troubleshoot, and resolve common PC problems with ease. While third-party solutions like Glary Utilities offer a powerful set of additional tools, knowing how to leverage Windows’ own system tools remains an essential skill for any user who wants to keep their PC running smoothly. This article explores the best practices for managing and using these built-in diagnostics, with practical examples and step-by-step guidance for both beginners and advanced users.

Why Use Built-in Diagnostics?

Windows’ diagnostic utilities are designed to be accessible, effective, and safe. Using these tools can help you:

\- Detect and fix hardware or software issues quickly. - Improve performance by identifying bottlenecks. - Troubleshoot startup problems and crashes. - Restore system health without the need for additional software.

Getting Started: Diagnostic Tools for Beginners

Which Diagnostics Utilities Should Beginners Use First?

For those new to system troubleshooting, Windows provides several user-friendly tools:

1\. Windows Troubleshooters

What do they do? Troubleshooters are automated tools that guide you through resolving issues with hardware, connectivity, sound, Windows Update, and more.

How to use: - Open Settings (Press Windows + I). - Go to Update & Security > Troubleshoot. - Select the troubleshooter that matches your issue (e.g., Internet Connections, Audio Playback), then click Run the troubleshooter. - Follow the on-screen instructions.

Real-world example: If your printer isn’t working, select the Printer troubleshooter to automatically find and fix any problems.

2\. Reliability Monitor

What does it do? Reliability Monitor gives you a timeline of your system’s stability and error events.

How to use: - Press Windows + R, type “perfmon /rel” and press Enter. - Examine the timeline for any red X icons or warnings. Click on events to see what happened.

Best practice: Check Reliability Monitor if your system has been crashing or acting sluggish. It often points directly to the faulty application or update.

3\. Check Disk Utility (CHKDSK)

What does it do? CHKDSK scans your hard drive for errors and attempts to fix them.

How to use: - Open File Explorer, right-click your C: drive, and select Properties. - Go to the Tools tab and click “Check” under Error checking. - Follow prompts to scan and repair the drive.

Advanced Diagnostics: Tools for Power Users

What Built-in Tools Offer More Detailed Insights?

Advanced users may need deeper diagnostics for performance bottlenecks or persistent errors.

1\. Event Viewer

What does it do? Event Viewer logs system, security, and application events. It’s indispensable for tracking down complex issues.

How to use: - Press Windows + X and select “Event Viewer.” - Navigate to Windows Logs > System or Application. - Double-click events with warnings or errors to read detailed information.

Best practice: Filter logs by critical errors when diagnosing unexpected shutdowns or blue screens (BSOD).

2\. Performance Monitor

What does it do? Performance Monitor tracks real-time system performance, letting you pinpoint hardware or software bottlenecks.

How to use: - Press Windows + R, type “perfmon,” and press Enter. - Use the “+” icon to add counters (CPU, memory, disk activity). - Watch for spikes or unusual patterns when running demanding applications.

Real-world example: Use Performance Monitor to track memory usage when a program starts slowing down, helping you decide whether to upgrade RAM or optimize startup items.

3\. System File Checker (SFC) and DISM

What do they do? SFC and DISM scan and repair corrupted Windows system files.

How to use SFC: - Open Command Prompt as Administrator. - Type: sfc /scannow and press Enter. - Wait for the scan to complete and follow prompts to fix issues.

How to use DISM: - In Command Prompt as Administrator, type: dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth - Wait for the process to finish.

Best practice: Run these scans if you encounter frequent crashes, missing features, or error messages related to Windows components.

Enhancing Maintenance With Third-Party System Tools

While Windows built-in utilities are robust, combining them with comprehensive third-party solutions can further streamline diagnostics and maintenance.

Best Practices for Smooth Diagnostics Management

For All Users:

\- Regularly run Windows Update to ensure all built-in diagnostic tools have the latest definitions. - Create restore points before making major changes or running advanced repair tools. - Use automated troubleshooters as a first step for common problems.

For Advanced Users:

\- Analyze system logs in Event Viewer before performing deeper repairs. - Schedule regular checks with Performance Monitor to spot emerging issues. - Combine SFC and DISM for comprehensive system file repairs. - Use third-party tools like Glary Utilities to automate routine health checks and cleanups.

Conclusion

Windows’ built-in diagnostic utilities make system management accessible and effective for all users. By following best practices—using automated troubleshooters, monitoring reliability, repairing system files, and supplementing with advanced or third-party tools when necessary—you can ensure your PC remains stable, secure, and high-performing.
