Having trouble with your Windows PC failing to start properly is a frustrating experience for users of all levels. Fortunately, there are several practical steps you can take to fix startup issues, ranging from simple checks to more advanced repair solutions. This guide walks you through these steps, providing real-world examples and useful tips to help get your computer back to normal.

What Are Common Signs of Windows Startup Issues?

Before starting any fixes, it’s important to recognize the typical symptoms of startup problems: - The PC gets stuck on the Windows logo or a black screen. - You see error messages such as “Boot device not found” or “Automatic Repair couldn’t repair your PC.” - The computer keeps restarting in a loop. - The desktop never appears, or the system freezes shortly after login.

What Are the Basic Startup Fix Solutions?

1\. Check Physical Connections Sometimes, simple issues like a loose power cable or a disconnected hard drive can prevent Windows from starting. Ensure all cables and external devices (USB drives, printers, etc.) are securely connected.

2\. Restart Your Computer A simple restart can resolve temporary glitches. If your PC is frozen, hold down the power button for 10 seconds to force a shutdown, then turn it back on.

3\. Remove External Devices Remove all USB drives, SD cards, and other peripherals. Sometimes, Windows tries to boot from these devices instead of your hard drive.

How Can Safe Mode Help?

Safe Mode loads Windows with only the essential drivers and services. It’s an excellent way to troubleshoot startup issues.

To enter Safe Mode: 1. Power on your PC and, as soon as Windows begins to load, hold the power button to force shutdown. Repeat this three times. 2. On the fourth startup, Windows will enter Recovery mode. 3. Select Troubleshoot > Advanced options > Startup Settings > Restart. 4. After restarting, press F4 to boot into Safe Mode.

Once in Safe Mode, you can: - Uninstall recent programs or drivers that may be causing problems. - Run antivirus scans to check for malware. - Use System Restore to return Windows to an earlier working state.

Why Should You Use [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com)?

Glary Utilities is a comprehensive tool that helps clean up and repair Windows, often resolving startup problems caused by software clutter or misconfigurations. In Safe Mode, open [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) and use features such as: - Disk Cleaner: Remove junk files and free up space. - Startup Manager: Disable unnecessary startup programs that may slow or block booting. - Registry Repair: Fix registry errors that can prevent Windows from loading. - Malware Remover: Scan and clean malware that could be disrupting startup.

Can You Fix Startup Issues with Automatic Repair?

Windows 10 and 11 include an Automatic Repair tool that can fix many boot problems.

To use Automatic Repair: 1. Interrupt the boot process three times (as described above) to access Recovery mode. 2. Select Troubleshoot > Advanced options > Startup Repair. 3. Follow the prompts to let Windows attempt to repair itself.

What Advanced Options Are Available If Basic Steps Don’t Work?

1\. System Restore If System Restore points are enabled, you can revert your system to a previous working state. - Go to Troubleshoot > Advanced options > System Restore. - Choose a restore point before the issue began.

2\. Check Disk for Errors Corrupted system files or hard disk errors can cause boot failures. - In Recovery mode, open Command Prompt. - Type chkdsk C: /f /r and press Enter. Replace C: with your Windows drive letter if different.

3\. Repair Master Boot Record (MBR) If you see errors like “Boot device not found,” the boot record may be corrupted. - In Command Prompt, type: - bootrec /fixmbr - bootrec /fixboot - bootrec /scanos - bootrec /rebuildbcd

4\. SFC and DISM Scans System File Checker (SFC) and Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool (DISM) can repair damaged Windows files. - In Command Prompt, type sfc /scannow and press Enter. - For deeper repairs, type DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth.

When Should You Consider a Windows Reset or Reinstallation?

If none of the above steps resolve the startup issue, resetting your PC or reinstalling Windows may be necessary.

To reset your PC: 1. Go to Troubleshoot > Reset this PC. 2. Choose whether to keep your files or remove everything.

A clean reinstallation of Windows should be your last resort and is best used when hardware faults are ruled out and software repairs fail.

How Can You Prevent Startup Issues in the Future?

1\. Regularly clean and repair your system using tools like [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) to remove junk files, fix registry errors, and manage startup programs. 2. Perform regular malware scans. 3. Keep Windows and all drivers updated. 4. Create regular backups and restore points, so you can recover easily if something goes wrong.

Conclusion

Windows startup issues can be caused by a variety of factors, from hardware glitches to software corruption. By following the steps in this guide, from simple hardware checks to using advanced repair tools like Glary Utilities, you can troubleshoot and fix most startup problems.
