Windows startup problems can be frustrating and often slow down your entire workflow. Whether your PC is taking too long to boot or you're facing startup errors, optimizing the Windows startup process is crucial for both performance and reliability. This article explores the top 10 ways to repair and optimize Windows startup on Windows 10 and 11, providing hands-on guidance suitable for both beginners and advanced users.

1\. Disable Unnecessary Startup Programs

For Beginners: Many applications set themselves to launch at startup, which can slow down your boot time. To disable them:

\- Right-click the taskbar and select Task Manager. - Go to the Startup tab. - Review the list; right-click and disable programs you don’t need immediately after startup (like chat apps, updaters, etc.).

For Advanced Users: You can also manage startup tasks using the System Configuration (msconfig) utility:

\- Press Win + R, type msconfig, and press Enter. - Go to the Startup tab (redirects to Task Manager in Windows 10/11).

Recommendation: Use Glary Utilities’ Startup Manager for a more detailed view and easy one-click disabling of unnecessary items.

2\. Check for Malware and Unwanted Software

For Beginners: Malware or unwanted software can hijack the startup process. Run a full scan with Windows Security (Defender).

For Advanced Users: Use reliable third-party anti-malware tools for a deeper scan.

Glary Utilities also includes a malware cleaner to remove threats that traditional antivirus programs might miss.

3\. Clean Up System Junk and Temporary Files

For Beginners: Open Windows Settings > System > Storage and run Storage Sense to remove temporary files.

For Advanced Users: Use built-in tools like Disk Cleanup (cleanmgr) or the command line for more control.

[Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com)’ 1-Click Maintenance tool cleans junk files, temp files, and broken shortcuts in one go, which can significantly speed up boot times.

4\. Repair Corrupted System Files

For Beginners: Windows has built-in tools like System File Checker (SFC). Open Command Prompt as administrator and type: sfc /scannow

For Advanced Users: If SFC finds issues it can’t fix, use: DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth

Glary Utilities’ Registry Repair tool can also help identify and repair registry-related startup issues.

5\. Update Your System and Drivers

For Beginners: Go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update and check for updates.

For Advanced Users: Update drivers using Device Manager or by downloading the latest versions from manufacturers’ websites.

Some optimization suites like Glary Utilities offer driver update features to ensure all hardware is running optimally.

6\. Adjust BIOS or UEFI Settings

For Advanced Users: Optimizing boot order and enabling Fast Boot in BIOS/UEFI can shave precious seconds off your startup time. To access BIOS/UEFI:

\- Restart your PC and press the required key (often F2, Del, or Esc) during boot. - Set your primary hard drive as the first boot device. - Enable Fast Boot if available.

Warning: Always take care when changing BIOS/UEFI settings.

7\. Check and Manage Windows Services

For Beginners: Disabling core services is NOT recommended unless you know what you’re doing.

For Advanced Users: Open the Services app (services.msc) and set unnecessary third-party services to Manual or Disabled. Research each service before changing.

Glary Utilities includes a service manager tool to help you identify non-essential services safely.

8\. Fix Startup Repair via Windows Recovery

For Beginners: If Windows won’t boot, access the Recovery Environment:

\- Force restart your PC three times to launch the Recovery menu. - Go to Troubleshoot > Advanced options > Startup Repair.

Follow the on-screen instructions.

For Advanced Users: Advanced troubleshooters can use Command Prompt in Recovery to perform boot repairs:

bootrec /fixmbr bootrec /fixboot bootrec /scanos bootrec /rebuildbcd

9\. Use System Restore or Reset

For Beginners: System Restore rolls your system back to a previous working state.

\- Open Control Panel > Recovery > Open System Restore. - Follow the wizard.

If that fails, consider a system reset (Settings > Update & Security > Recovery > Reset this PC).

For Advanced Users: Use advanced recovery tools or restore from a system image.

10\. Optimize and Defragment Hard Drives

For Beginners: Go to Windows Search and type "Defragment and Optimize Drives." Select your main drive and click Optimize.

For SSDs, Windows will run TRIM, not traditional defragmentation.

For Advanced Users: Run command line optimization: defrag C: /O

Glary Utilities provides a Disk Defrag tool with advanced options for both HDDs and SSDs, optimizing performance and boot times.
