Temporary files can accumulate quickly on your Windows 11 system, taking up valuable storage space and, over time, slowing down your PC. Regularly cleaning up these files is essential for maintaining optimal performance and freeing up storage. This guide introduces the top 10 ways to configure and perform temporary file cleanup in Windows 11, with practical steps for both beginners and advanced users. For those seeking an all-in-one solution, Glary Utilities is recommended for its comprehensive cleanup capabilities.

Beginner-Friendly Cleanup Methods

1\. Using Windows Storage Sense

Windows 11 features Storage Sense, an automatic disk cleanup tool. To enable and configure it:

\- Open Settings (press Windows + I). - Go to System > Storage. - Turn on Storage Sense. - Click “Storage Sense” to adjust settings, such as how often it runs and what types of files to clean (e.g., temporary files, downloads, Recycle Bin). - To run it immediately, click “Run Storage Sense now”.

This is an easy, set-and-forget solution for ongoing cleanup.

2\. Manual Temporary File Cleanup via Settings

Windows 11 allows you to manually remove temporary files:

\- Go to Settings > System > Storage. - Click “Temporary files”. - Review the categories (Windows Update Cleanup, Temporary Internet Files, etc.). - Select the files you want to remove. - Click “Remove files”.

This method is straightforward and gives you control over what is deleted.

3\. Disk Cleanup Utility

Disk Cleanup is a classic Windows tool for freeing space:

\- Press Windows + S, type “Disk Cleanup”, and select it. - Choose your system drive (usually C:). - Check “Temporary files” and any other categories you wish. - Click “OK” then “Delete Files”.

Disk Cleanup is reliable and safe for beginners.

4\. Using Glary Utilities for Effortless Cleanup

5\. Cleaning Browser Temporary Files

Browsers store temporary files that can add up over time:

\- In Microsoft Edge: Go to Settings > Privacy, search, and services > Clear browsing data. - In Chrome: Go to Settings > Privacy and security > Clear browsing data. - Select cached images, cookies, and other site data. - Confirm and clear data.

Doing this regularly keeps your browsers and system responsive.

Intermediate and Advanced Cleanup Techniques

6\. Scheduled Task for Disk Cleanup

For users wanting automation, you can schedule Disk Cleanup:

\- Open Task Scheduler (type “Task Scheduler” in Start). - Choose “Create Basic Task”. - Name your task (e.g., “Monthly Temp File Cleanup”). - Set a schedule (daily/weekly/monthly). - For “Action”, select “Start a Program” and type: cleanmgr.exe /sagerun:1 - Complete the wizard.

This ensures regular cleanup without manual intervention.

7\. Command Prompt Quick-Cleanup

Advanced users can use command line for cleanup:

\- Open Command Prompt as administrator. - Type: del /q/f/s %TEMP%\\\* - Press Enter.

This will delete all files in the user’s temp folder quickly.

8\. Batch Script for Repeated Cleanup

To automate temp file cleanup, create a batch file:

\- Open Notepad. - Enter these lines: del /q/f/s %TEMP%\\\* del /q/f/s C:\\Windows\\Temp\\\* - Save as “cleantemp.bat”. - Right-click and run as administrator as needed.

This is useful for power users who want fast, repeatable cleanups.

9\. Group Policy for Enterprise Environments

Network administrators can enforce cleanup policies:

\- Press Windows + R, type “gpedit.msc”, and press Enter. - Navigate to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > System > Storage Sense. - Set “Configure Storage Sense” and adjust cleanup intervals and content.

This is ideal for managing multiple systems in an organization.

10\. Using Third-Party Utilities for Advanced Cleanup
