Windows diagnostic utilities are essential tools that help identify, troubleshoot, and resolve common system problems. Backing up these tools ensures you always have access to them, even if something goes wrong with your operating system. As a beginner Windows user, here’s how you can easily backup these utilities and keep your PC healthy and efficient.

What Are Windows Diagnostic Utilities?

Diagnostic utilities are programs built into Windows (or available as third-party downloads) that help you test hardware, check system health, and fix common computer problems. Examples include:

\- Windows Memory Diagnostic - Check Disk (chkdsk) - System File Checker (sfc) - Device Manager - Reliability Monitor - Third-party tools like [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com)

Why Should You Backup Diagnostic Utilities?

Having backups makes it easier to recover from unexpected issues like system crashes, malware attacks, or failed Windows updates. If your system becomes unstable, you can quickly access these tools from your backup and start troubleshooting right away.

How Can You Backup Windows Diagnostic Utilities?

Since many of Windows’ diagnostic tools are built into the system and not separate programs, you can’t simply copy them to a USB drive. However, you can make sure you have easy access to them—even if Windows fails to start—by using the following practical approaches:

Create a System Repair Disc or Recovery Drive

A System Repair Disc or Recovery Drive allows you to boot your PC and access diagnostic tools, even if Windows isn’t working.

Steps to create a Recovery Drive:

1\. Connect a blank USB flash drive (at least 8GB). 2. Open the Start menu, type “Create a recovery drive,” and select the option. 3. In the Recovery Drive wizard, check “Back up system files to the recovery drive” (if available), then click Next. 4. Select your USB drive, then click Create.

Now, if your PC fails, you can boot from this USB drive and access troubleshooting utilities like System Restore, Command Prompt (for chkdsk and sfc), and more.

Backup Third-Party Diagnostic Tools

If you use third-party diagnostic tools, such as Glary Utilities, it’s wise to keep their installers or portable versions backed up.

Practical steps:

1\. Download the latest installer or portable version of your preferred tool (from the official website). 2. Save the installer or portable folder to a backup location, such as an external hard drive or USB stick. 3. Optionally, keep a text file with your license key (if you own a Pro version).

For example, [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) offers a portable version that doesn’t require installation. This makes it easy to run on any Windows PC without leaving traces behind. Simply copy the portable folder to your backup drive.

Save Shortcuts to Built-in Tools

To access built-in tools quickly:

1\. Right-click on your desktop, select New > Shortcut. 2. For System File Checker, enter: C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe /c sfc /scannow 3. For Check Disk, enter: C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe /c chkdsk C: /F 4. Name the shortcut and click Finish.

Copy these shortcuts to your backup USB drive. When you need them, double-click to run the diagnostic.

Document How to Access Diagnostic Tools

Even if you have your tools backed up, it’s helpful to keep a simple text file with instructions. For example:

\- How to enter Windows Recovery Environment (press F8 or Shift+Restart) - Command-line instructions for sfc and chkdsk - Steps to start Windows Memory Diagnostic (type “mdsched” in Start menu)

Include this document in your backup so you always have step-by-step guidance.

Keep Windows Up to Date

Regularly update Windows so your diagnostic tools stay current and functional. Updates often fix issues in built-in utilities.
