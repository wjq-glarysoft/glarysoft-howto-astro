Temporary files are essential for Windows to function smoothly, but over time, their accumulation can slow down your computer and eat up precious storage space. Whether you’re a novice user wanting a simple cleaning solution or an advanced user looking for in-depth optimization, cleaning up Windows temporary files is a vital step toward maintaining a healthy system. This guide covers practical, step-by-step methods for Windows 10 and 11 users, including both manual and advanced automated options using [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com).

Why Should You Clean Temporary Files?

Temporary files are created by Windows and various applications for short-term use—think software installations, browsing the web, or document editing. These files are meant to be disposable, but they often linger long after their usefulness has passed. Regular cleanup can:

\- Free up disk space - Improve overall system performance - Reduce the risk of software glitches - Enhance privacy by removing traces of your activity

Getting Started: Identifying Temporary Files

Before you begin, understand what you’ll be deleting. Common types of temporary files include:

\- Windows temporary files (C:\\Windows\\Temp) - User-specific temp files (%temp%) - Browser cache and cookies - System update leftovers - Application-generated temp data

If you’re new to PC maintenance, these built-in Windows tools will help you safely clean up temp files without risk.

Using Windows Settings

1\. Open Settings by pressing Windows + I. 2. Click on System, then Storage. 3. Under Storage, select Temporary files. 4. Windows will scan and display a list. Check the boxes for the types of temporary files you wish to remove (e.g., Temporary files, Thumbnails, Recycle Bin, etc.). 5. Click Remove files and wait for the process to finish.

Cleaning Temporary Files with Disk Cleanup

1\. Press Windows + S and type Disk Cleanup, then select the app. 2. Choose the drive you want to clean (usually C:) and click OK. 3. In the Disk Cleanup window, check the types of files you want to delete (Temporary files, Thumbnails, etc.). 4. Click OK, then Delete Files to confirm.

Manual Cleanup via Command Line

Type the following commands, pressing Enter after each: - del /q/f/s %TEMP%\\\* - del /q/f/s C:\\Windows\\Temp\\\* 3. This will force-delete files in the temp directories. Some files in use may not be deleted—this is normal.
