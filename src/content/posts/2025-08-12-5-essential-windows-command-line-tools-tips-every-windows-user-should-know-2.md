The Windows command line, often called Command Prompt or CMD, is a powerful tool that many users overlook. While modern Windows versions offer a polished graphical interface, the command line remains a fast, flexible way to manage, troubleshoot, and optimize your PC. Whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned Windows user, mastering a few essential command line tools can save you time and resolve issues more efficiently. Here are five must-know tips to make the most of Windows command line utilities, with practical examples and advice for all skill levels.

Why Should You Use Command Line Tools?

Command line tools let you access powerful system features that may be buried or unavailable in the standard Windows interface. They’re invaluable for tasks such as automating maintenance, diagnosing problems, and managing files quickly. Even if you’re not a tech expert, knowing a few key commands can make your Windows experience smoother.

1\. How Can You Quickly Check System Information Using Systeminfo?

The systeminfo command displays detailed information about your PC, including Windows version, hardware specs, network settings, and more. This is especially handy when troubleshooting or preparing for upgrades.

Step-by-step example: 1. Press Windows + R, type cmd, and hit Enter. 2. In the Command Prompt window, type: systeminfo 3. Press Enter.

You’ll see a comprehensive list of details, such as installed RAM, system manufacturer, BIOS version, and network adapters. This info is essential when seeking support or verifying system capabilities.

2\. What’s the Easiest Way to Manage Disk Space with Cleanmgr and Dir?

Windows includes built-in tools to help manage disk space, but the command line versions offer additional flexibility.

To run Disk Cleanup via command line: 1. Open Command Prompt as Administrator. 2. Type: cleanmgr /sageset:1 cleanmgr /sagerun:1

This lets you customize which files to clean, then runs the cleanup. It’s useful for automating routine maintenance.

To check which folders use the most space: 1. In Command Prompt, navigate to the drive or folder you want to analyze (e.g., cd C:\\Users\\YourName). 2. Type: dir /s /o:-s This lists all files and subdirectories, sorted by size (largest first).

For a more comprehensive disk cleanup and analysis, Glary Utilities offers an easy-to-use interface with deep cleaning features, duplicate file finder, and disk space analyzer—perfect for users wanting a point-and-click solution without command line syntax.

3\. How Do You Monitor Network Connections Using Netstat?

The netstat command helps you view active network connections and troubleshoot networking problems, such as unknown applications connecting to the internet.

To display all active connections: 1. Open Command Prompt. 2. Type: netstat -ano

You’ll see a list of connections, their status, and the process IDs (PIDs) using each connection. For deeper analysis, match the PID to specific applications in Task Manager—a useful step when tracking down suspicious or unwanted network activity.

4\. How Can You Easily Repair System Files with SFC and DISM?

Windows system files sometimes become corrupted, causing performance issues or crashes. Two essential tools can help:

System File Checker (SFC): 1. Open Command Prompt as Administrator. 2. Type: sfc /scannow This will scan and automatically repair corrupted system files.

Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool (DISM): If SFC can’t fix the issue, use DISM: 1. In Command Prompt as Administrator, type: dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth This command checks and repairs the Windows image, which SFC uses to restore files.

These tools are vital for anyone experiencing recurring Windows errors, slowdowns, or system instability.

5\. What’s the Best Way to Automate Repetitive Tasks Using Batch Files?

You can create batch scripts (simple text files with .bat extension) to automate routine maintenance. For example, you can combine several of the above commands to regularly back up folders, clean temp files, or check for system errors.

Example batch script to run SFC and Cleanmgr: - Open Notepad. - Type: sfc /scannow cleanmgr /sagerun:1 - Save as maintenance.bat. - Double-click to run whenever you need a quick health check.
