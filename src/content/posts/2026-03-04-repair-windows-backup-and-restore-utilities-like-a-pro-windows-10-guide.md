Windows 10 includes built-in tools for creating backups and restoring data, but sometimes users encounter problems such as failed backups, corrupted restore points, or inaccessible images. Repairing these utilities often requires a structured approach using native system tools and trusted maintenance software. This guide walks through practical steps to identify, repair, and optimize the Backup and Restore functions like a professional.

What causes Backup and Restore issues in Windows 10?

Common reasons include system file corruption, outdated Windows services, damaged backup images, or disabled system components like the Volume Shadow Copy Service. In other cases, third-party software conflicts or disk errors can prevent normal backup operations. Recognizing these causes helps determine the appropriate repair method.

How to check and repair system files

System file corruption is a frequent cause of malfunctioning backup and restore utilities. 1. Open the Start menu and type Command Prompt. 2. Right-click it and select Run as administrator. 3. Type the command: sfc /scannow and press Enter. 4. Allow the System File Checker to complete its scan. If it finds issues, it will attempt automatic repair. 5. Restart the computer after completion.

For deeper repair, run the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool: 1. In the same administrator Command Prompt, enter: DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth 2. Wait for the process to finish and then restart your PC.

This process ensures that the backup system components are restored to their original state.

How to re-enable Backup and Restore services

Backup and Restore depend on several Windows services. If they are stopped or set to Manual mode, backups may fail. 1. Press Windows + R, type services.msc, and press Enter. 2. Locate the following services: - Windows Backup - Volume Shadow Copy - Task Scheduler 3. For each service, right-click and choose Properties. 4. Set Startup type to Automatic and click Start if the service is not running. 5. Click Apply and OK.

Restart the computer and test the backup feature again. This step often resolves the “Windows Backup service not running” error.

How to fix damaged restore points and system images

If System Restore fails or cannot locate restore points, clear old restore data and create a new restore point. 1. Open Control Panel and go to System and Security > System. 2. Select System Protection from the left panel. 3. Under Protection Settings, select the drive and click Configure. 4. Choose Delete to remove old restore points. 5. Click Create to make a fresh restore point once done.

For backup images that fail to load, open File Explorer, locate the backup folder, and rename the old backup set. Then start a new backup using the Backup and Restore (Windows 7) utility in Control Panel.

How to run a full maintenance and cleanup with Glary Utilities

Sometimes, leftover temporary files, registry errors, or disk fragmentation interfere with the backup process. Using [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) simplifies this maintenance task. 1. Install and open [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com). 2. Select the 1-Click Maintenance tab. 3. Check items such as Registry Cleaner, Temporary Files Cleaner, and Shortcuts Fixer. 4. Click Scan for Issues, then Repair Problems.

This process removes junk data, corrects registry inconsistencies, and optimizes disk performance. Regular maintenance keeps the backup system efficient and error-free.

Additionally, Glary Utilities includes a Disk Repair tool that can detect and fix file system errors. Run it periodically to ensure the drive used for backups is healthy and reliable.

How to verify backup and restore functionality

After applying the above repairs, perform a test to confirm that both backups and restores work properly. 1. Open Control Panel > Backup and Restore (Windows 7). 2. Select Set up backup and choose a destination drive. 3. Let Windows create a new backup. 4. Once completed, go to the Restore section and try restoring an individual file to a test folder.

This verification ensures that your backup schedule, image creation, and restore operations function as intended.

Maintaining a reliable Windows backup and restore environment requires consistent attention to system health. By repairing system files, re-enabling critical services, cleaning up unnecessary data, and verifying each process, you can restore full reliability to the built-in Windows utilities. Regular checks with system tools and [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) maintain long-term stability, ensuring that your data protection features perform at their best every time.
