Windows comes packed with a variety of command line tools designed to help users maintain, troubleshoot, and optimize their systems. While these tools may seem daunting at first, they offer powerful ways to control your computer, automate tasks, and fix issues. This guide explains what command line tools are available in Windows, how built-in features can help, and provides actionable examples for both beginners and advanced users. Plus, discover how all-in-one utilities like Glary Utilities can complement or simplify many command line tasks.

What Are Windows Command Line Tools?

Command line tools are programs accessed via the Command Prompt (cmd) or PowerShell in Windows. Unlike regular apps with graphical interfaces, these tools require you to type commands. Although this may seem complicated, command line tools are often faster and more flexible for certain system tasks.

Why Use Command Line Tools Instead of Only Graphical Tools?

1\. Automation: Scripts can automate repetitive tasks. 2. More Control: Access features not always available in graphical interfaces. 3. Troubleshooting: Diagnose and fix problems even when the regular desktop won’t load. 4. Performance: Command line tools can be faster and use fewer system resources.

Beginner’s Section: Essential Command Line Tools and How to Use Them

Getting Started

Open Command Prompt: Press Windows Key + R, type cmd, and press Enter. Open PowerShell: Press Windows Key + X, choose Windows PowerShell.

Common Built-in Tools and Examples

How Built-in GUI Tools Can Help Beginners

Although command line tools are powerful, built-in Windows features like Windows Security, Storage Sense, and Task Manager provide friendly interfaces for many of the same tasks. Beginners should use these graphical tools first, and turn to command line tools for advanced or troubleshooting scenarios.

Intermediate and Advanced Section: Power Tips and Automation

1\. PowerShell Automation

PowerShell extends command line capabilities significantly. For example: - To get a list of installed programs: Get-WmiObject -Class Win32\_Product - To stop a service: Stop-Service -Name "wuauserv"

2\. Batch Files and Scripts

Automate repetitive tasks by saving a series of commands in a .bat or .ps1 file and running them with a double-click.

3\. Network Diagnostics

Use command line tools for troubleshooting network issues: - ipconfig /all — View all network configuration. - ping google.com — Test connectivity. - netstat -an — View open network connections.

4\. Advanced Disk Management

Manage disks and partitions with diskpart: - Open Command Prompt as Administrator. - Type diskpart and press Enter. - Use list disk, select disk, or clean to manage disks.
