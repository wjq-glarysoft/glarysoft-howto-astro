Monitoring and analyzing Windows 11 performance isn’t just for IT professionals—it’s a critical skill for any user aiming to keep their system running at peak efficiency. Intermediate users can take advantage of built-in tools, advanced performance analyzers, and third-party utilities to gain deep insights into what their system is doing and how to optimize it.

What tools should you start with for real-time system monitoring?

Windows 11 provides several built-in utilities that can display real-time system performance. Task Manager is still the quickest way to view CPU, memory, disk, and network activity. Open it with Ctrl + Shift + Esc, then navigate to the Performance tab. Here, you can watch usage graphs for each hardware component. For an intermediate-level approach, right-click on a process under the Details tab, select “Go to Service(s)” to trace which services are tied to that process. This helps detect background tasks consuming unnecessary resources.

For deeper insight, use the Resource Monitor. Type “resmon” in the Start menu and open it. Resource Monitor gives more granular data than Task Manager, showing file, network, and disk access per process. You can identify which applications constantly read or write to the disk—often a cause of slow system response.

How can you analyze performance over time rather than just in real-time?

Windows Performance Monitor (perfmon) allows advanced users to create custom data collector sets that log system activity over time. Launch it from the Run dialog by typing perfmon. Under Data Collector Sets, create a new one and choose performance counters like Memory, LogicalDisk, and Processor. Set a sampling interval—for example, every 15 seconds—and let it run while you use your system normally.

Later, open the recorded log and analyze the data to detect spikes or patterns in resource usage. This is especially useful for identifying intermittent slowdowns that don’t appear during short monitoring sessions.

When should you use third-party analysis utilities?

While Windows tools are powerful, third-party utilities like Glary Utilities provide a more user-friendly and comprehensive optimization approach. [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) consolidates system maintenance and monitoring into one interface, offering modules like Startup Manager, Disk Cleanup, and Performance Monitor.

Its built-in Performance Monitor sits in the system tray, displaying real-time CPU, RAM, and disk usage while allowing one-click optimization actions such as memory cleanup or process termination. The Startup Manager helps you analyze which programs delay boot time and lets you disable them safely. This combined view simplifies performance analysis and eliminates the need to open separate monitoring tools.

How can you interpret data to improve performance?

After monitoring performance, the next step is optimization. For instance, if Resource Monitor reveals a process frequently writing to disk, check whether it’s a background indexing service or an outdated driver. Disabling or updating it can improve responsiveness dramatically.

If your Performance Monitor logs show consistent high memory usage even with few applications open, check for memory leaks using Task Manager’s Details tab—processes with memory usage that continuously rises without release are likely culprits.

[Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) can further help by cleaning temporary files, repairing registry errors, and managing startup applications, ensuring that resource usage remains balanced.

What advanced methods improve system insight and stability?

Intermediate users can benefit from Event Viewer for log-based analysis. Access it by typing “eventvwr” in the Start menu. Review System and Application logs for performance-related warnings or driver errors. Combining this with data from Performance Monitor helps pinpoint root causes of instability.

Another advanced method is using Windows Reliability Monitor. Type “reliability” in the search bar and open “View reliability history.” This visual timeline highlights application crashes, system updates, and driver issues, providing quick access to troubleshooting details.

Finally, integrate Glary Utilities’ automatic maintenance schedule. Its 1-Click Maintenance feature automates cleaning, repairing, and optimizing Windows, preventing small issues from accumulating. Over time, this proactive approach ensures smoother performance and fewer performance anomalies to analyze.

By blending Windows’ built-in diagnostic tools with advanced utilities like [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com), intermediate users can transform system monitoring and analysis into a strategic optimization process. The result is a faster, more stable, and longer-lasting Windows 11 environment that performs consistently under any workload.
