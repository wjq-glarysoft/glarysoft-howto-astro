Windows file sharing is a powerful feature, allowing you to collaborate and share resources across your network. However, when planning for backups or migrations, the challenge isn’t just copying files—it’s preserving their sharing settings and NTFS permissions. These permissions dictate who can access what, and how. For anyone managing shared folders on a home or small office network, understanding how to back up and restore these settings is crucial.

Why Do File Sharing and Permissions Matter?

File sharing in Windows allows you to make folders accessible to other users on your network. NTFS permissions provide granular control over who can read, modify, or delete files. If you only back up files without preserving permissions, you risk exposing sensitive data or locking out legitimate users after a restore. This can interrupt workflows and create security issues.

What Should You Back Up?

1\. Shared folders and their contents. 2. NTFS permissions (security settings). 3. Share information (which folders are shared and their share permissions).

How to Back Up NTFS Permissions and Shares

Standard file copy operations (even with external drives) do not always retain permissions and share settings. Intermediate users can use built-in Windows tools and third-party utilities to ensure a complete backup.

Backing Up Files with Permissions Using Robocopy

Robocopy (Robust File Copy) is a powerful command-line tool that can copy files and folders along with their NTFS permissions.

Example:

1\. Open Command Prompt as Administrator. 2. Run the following command:

robocopy "C:\\SharedFolder" "D:\\Backup\\SharedFolder" /E /COPYALL /SEC /SECFIX /R:2 /W:3

Explanation: - /E copies all subfolders (even empty ones). - /COPYALL copies all file information, including data, attributes, timestamps, and NTFS permissions. - /SEC and /SECFIX ensure security information (permissions) are copied. - /R:2 and /W:3 set retry parameters for network reliability.

This method ensures the backed-up copy on D: retains the same permissions as the source.

Exporting and Restoring Share Information

While NTFS permissions are stored on the file system, share definitions are stored in the Windows registry. To back these up:

To Export Share Definitions: 1. Press Win+R, type \`regedit\`, and press Enter. 2. Navigate to HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\LanmanServer\\Shares 3. Right-click on the 'Shares' key and select Export. 4. Save the .reg file to your backup location.

To Restore Share Definitions: 1. Double-click the saved .reg file on the destination machine. 2. Restart the 'Server' service or reboot your computer for changes to take effect.

Backing Up Permissions with ICACLS

ICACLS is another command-line tool that can backup and restore NTFS permissions.

To backup permissions: icacls "C:\\SharedFolder" /save "D:\\Backup\\SharedFolder\_perms.txt" /T

To restore permissions: icacls "C:\\SharedFolder" /restore "D:\\Backup\\SharedFolder\_perms.txt"

Using Glary Utilities for File and Permission Management

Glary Utilities offers a user-friendly approach for intermediate users to manage files and keep their system in top shape. The File Management module simplifies browsing, copying, and securing files, while the integrated backup features help schedule regular backups of important folders. For more advanced users, Glary Utilities’ backup features don’t directly save share definitions, but its 1-Click Maintenance and file management tools ensure your files, including their structure, are well-organized and protected.

For full permission backup and share export, combine Glary Utilities’ routine cleanup with manual or script-based permission backup as described above.

Best Practices and Real-World Tips

\- Regularly schedule permission-aware backups using Robocopy or ICACLS to an external drive or network location. - Always document your share and permission structure, especially before major system changes. - Use [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) regularly to clean up redundant files and ensure your file shares remain organized. - Test your restore procedure: On a different folder or test machine, restore files and permissions to verify nothing is lost or misconfigured.

Conclusion

Backing up Windows file shares and permissions requires more than just copying files. By using tools like Robocopy, ICACLS, and exporting registry shares, you can ensure a disaster recovery or migration process that keeps both your data and its security intact. Complement these steps with [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com)’ file management and maintenance features for a comprehensive approach to file and folder management in Windows.
