Monitoring and analyzing your Windows system is crucial for maintaining optimal performance, security, and functionality. For advanced users, this involves going beyond basic tools and employing sophisticated techniques and utilities to gain deeper insights. Here, we explore some advanced methods to keep your Windows system in check.

1\. Understanding Resource Monitor

The Resource Monitor is a powerful tool that provides real-time data on how your system's resources are being used. To access it, press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager, navigate to the Performance tab, and click on "Open Resource Monitor."

\- CPU: This tab shows which processes are consuming the most CPU resources. This is useful for identifying applications that might be hogging CPU power. - Memory: It displays memory usage and helps in spotting memory leaks or applications using excessive memory. - Disk: Use this to monitor disk activity. If your disk usage is constantly high, it could suggest a bottleneck. - Network: Monitor network activity to identify applications consuming bandwidth or unusual network traffic patterns.

2\. Using Performance Monitor

Windows Performance Monitor is a versatile tool for creating detailed reports and setting up alerts for system performance. Start it by typing "perfmon" in the Run dialog (Win + R).

\- Creating a Data Collector Set: Navigate to Data Collector Sets > User Defined. Right-click and select New > Data Collector Set. You can set custom performance counters to track specific metrics over time. - Setting Alerts: Navigate to Data Collector Sets and create an alert that triggers when certain conditions are met, such as CPU usage exceeding a specific threshold.

3\. Analyzing with Windows Event Viewer

The Event Viewer is essential for diagnosing system and application issues. Access it by typing "eventvwr" in the Run dialog.

\- System Logs: Check the System log under Windows Logs to find critical errors and warnings that may hint at hardware failures or driver issues. - Application Logs: Use this to monitor software-related issues. If a program crashes, details will often be logged here.

4\. Exploring PowerShell Commands

PowerShell allows for advanced system monitoring through scripts and commandlets.

\- Checking System Health: Use the "Get-ComputerInfo" command to retrieve comprehensive system information. Combine this with "Get-EventLog" to extract specific event log entries for detailed analysis. - Monitoring Processes: Use "Get-Process" to list running processes. You can filter by specific parameters to find processes that consume an unusual amount of resources.

5\. Utilizing Third-Party Tools: Glary Utilities

For those looking for a comprehensive solution to streamline the process of monitoring and maintaining their system, Glary Utilities offers an excellent suite of tools.

\- Disk Cleanup: Automatically identifies and removes junk files, freeing up valuable disk space and improving performance. - Startup Manager: Allows you to manage startup programs effectively, reducing boot time and system strain. - System Information: Provides a detailed report on your system's hardware and software, helping identify potential issues. - Process Manager: An alternative to Windows Task Manager, offering more in-depth insights into running processes.

By incorporating these advanced techniques and tools into your routine, you can ensure that your Windows system remains in peak condition, thus enhancing both performance and longevity. Regular monitoring not only optimizes efficiency but also preemptively identifies potential issues before they escalate into significant problems.
