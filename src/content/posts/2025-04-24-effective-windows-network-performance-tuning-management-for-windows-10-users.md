Managing network performance on Windows 10 can be crucial for both home users and businesses. Whether you're experiencing sluggish internet speeds or want to ensure your network is running optimally, there are several advanced techniques and tools you can use to optimize your network performance. This guide will provide practical, actionable advice for both beginners and advanced users looking to improve their Windows 10 network performance.

What Basic Steps Can Beginners Take?

1\. Check Your Internet Speed: Begin by checking your internet speed using online tools such as Speedtest. This will help you determine if your network is underperforming or if it’s an issue with external factors.

2\. Restart Your Router: Sometimes, simply restarting your router can resolve connectivity issues. Unplug your router, wait for about 10 seconds, and then plug it back in.

3\. Update Your Network Drivers: Outdated drivers can cause network issues. Go to Device Manager, locate your network adapter under "Network adapters," right-click, and select "Update driver."

4\. Use Windows Troubleshooter: Windows 10 includes a built-in troubleshooter that can help identify and fix common network problems. Go to Settings > Update & Security > Troubleshoot and select "Internet Connections" then click "Run the troubleshooter."

How Can Advanced Users Improve Network Performance?

1\. Adjust Network Adapter Settings: - Open Device Manager, right-click on your network adapter, and select Properties. - Navigate to the Advanced tab and tweak settings such as Jumbo Packet, Large Send Offload, and other advanced features for better performance. These settings can vary greatly depending on your network adapter.

2\. Enable QoS (Quality of Service): - QoS settings can prioritize certain types of network traffic over others, ensuring that important data gets through more quickly. - Open the Group Policy Editor (type \`gpedit.msc\` in the search bar), and navigate to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Network > QoS Packet Scheduler. - Configure settings under "Limit reservable bandwidth" to manage and prioritize bandwidth effectively.

3\. Disable Background Apps: - Some apps running in the background consume significant bandwidth. - Go to Settings > Privacy > Background apps, and toggle off apps that are not needed.

4\. Use Windows PowerShell for Advanced Tweaks: - As an advanced user, you can use commands in PowerShell to manage your network settings more effectively. - For instance, the command \`Get-NetTCPSetting\` can help you view current TCP configurations, and you can adjust them using \`Set-NetTCPSetting\`.
