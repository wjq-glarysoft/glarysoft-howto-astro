A firewall is your PC’s front-line defense against unwanted network access, blocking harmful traffic and keeping your data private. Windows includes a built-in firewall, but many users never explore its full potential. In this guide, you'll learn how to set up and manage Windows Firewall effectively, from the basics to advanced configuration. We’ll show you step-by-step how to keep your system protected, and how tools like Glary Utilities can help you maintain privacy and security.

Why Is the Windows Firewall Important?

Windows Firewall acts as a barrier between your PC and the internet. It monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic and blocks harmful connections. A properly set-up firewall prevents hackers, malware, and even some types of ransomware from accessing your computer.

Beginner Guide: Windows Firewall Basics

How Do I Access Windows Firewall?

1\. Click the Start button or press the Windows key. 2. Type Windows Security and select it from the results. 3. In Windows Security, click Firewall & network protection.

You’ll see three network types: - Domain network (for business/enterprise environments) - Private network (home or work network) - Public network (coffee shop, airport, etc.)

For home users, you’ll typically use the Private network setting.

How Do I Turn the Firewall On or Off?

1\. In Firewall & network protection, click your active network. 2. Toggle the Microsoft Defender Firewall switch to On.

Important: It’s not recommended to turn the firewall off unless you’re troubleshooting specific problems.

How Do I Allow a Program Through the Firewall?

Sometimes, you’ll want programs (like a game or Zoom) to communicate through the firewall.

1\. In Firewall & network protection, click Allow an app through firewall. 2. Click Change settings (you may need administrator approval). 3. Find the app in the list, or click Allow another app… to add it. 4. Tick both Private and Public if you trust the app and need it on all networks. 5. Click OK.

Real-World Example: Allowing Steam Through the Firewall You’ve just installed Steam, but games won’t connect online. 1. Follow the Allow an app through firewall steps. 2. Find Steam, tick the boxes, and save changes. 3. Restart Steam—it should now connect without issues.

Intermediate Tasks: Customizing Firewall Rules

How Can I Block a Specific Application?

1\. Open Windows Security > Firewall & network protection. 2. Click Advanced settings to open Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security. 3. In the left panel, select Outbound Rules for outgoing traffic or Inbound Rules for incoming traffic. 4. Click New Rule on the right panel. 5. Select Program, then Next. 6. Browse to the app’s .exe file, then Next. 7. Choose Block the connection, then Next. 8. Decide which profiles (Domain, Private, Public) this rule applies to. 9. Name the rule and click Finish.

Example: Block an old, unused app from accessing the internet to improve privacy and reduce risks.

Advanced Users: Fine-Tuning and Monitoring

How Do I Monitor and Audit Firewall Activity?

1\. In the Advanced Security window, click Monitoring in the left panel. 2. View active firewall rules and connections. 3. Use Event Viewer (type eventvwr.msc in Start) and navigate to Windows Logs > Security to check for suspicious connection attempts.

How Do I Create Custom Firewall Rules?

For advanced users, you can create rules based on protocol (TCP/UDP), specific ports (for example, block port 445 used by file sharing), and IP addresses (allow only certain devices).

Regular Maintenance: Why and How?

Over time, you may allow multiple apps through the firewall, which could open up unnecessary vulnerabilities. It's important to review these settings regularly.
