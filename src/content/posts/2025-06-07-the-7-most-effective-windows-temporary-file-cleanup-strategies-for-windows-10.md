Temporary files can accumulate on your Windows 10 PC over time, taking up precious disk space and sometimes even slowing down your system. Cleaning up these files regularly is a crucial part of PC maintenance. In this article, you’ll find seven effective strategies for removing temporary files in Windows 10. Each method includes step-by-step instructions, with sections tailored for both beginners and advanced users.

Why Should You Clean Up Temporary Files?

Temporary files are created by Windows and various programs to store intermediate data. While they’re useful in the short term, they can linger long after you’re done with a task, wasting space and potentially causing performance issues. Regularly cleaning them up frees disk space and can help keep your PC running smoothly.

Beginner Strategies

1\. Using Windows 10 Storage Sense

Storage Sense is a built-in feature in Windows 10 that helps automate the temporary file cleanup process.

How to Enable and Use Storage Sense: - Click the Start button and select Settings (the gear icon). - Go to System, then click on Storage. - Under Storage, turn on Storage Sense by toggling the switch. - Click on “Configure Storage Sense or run it now.” - Here, you can set how often Storage Sense runs and what it should clean (temporary files, recycle bin, etc.). - To clean up immediately, scroll down and click “Clean now.”

Why this works: Storage Sense is easy to set up, automates cleanups, and reduces the risk of manual errors.

2\. Deleting Temporary Files via Windows Settings

Windows 10 allows you to delete temporary files directly from the Settings app.

Step-by-Step Instructions: - Open Settings and navigate to System > Storage. - Under Local Disk (C:), click “Temporary files.” - Windows will scan your drive and list different types of temporary files. - Select the boxes next to the file types you wish to delete (for example, “Temporary files,” “Recycle Bin,” “Delivery Optimization Files”). - Click “Remove files” to delete them.

This method is straightforward and safe for all users.

3\. Running Disk Cleanup Utility

Disk Cleanup is a classic tool for removing unnecessary files, including system-generated temporary files.

How to Use Disk Cleanup: - Press the Windows key, type “Disk Cleanup,” and select the app. - Choose the drive you want to clean (usually C:), then click OK. - Disk Cleanup will calculate how much space you can free up. - In the list, check “Temporary files” and any other categories you want to remove. - Click OK, then click “Delete Files” to confirm.

Disk Cleanup provides a safe and reliable way to clean up a range of system files.

Intermediate Strategies

4\. Manually Clearing the Windows Temp Folder

For users comfortable with navigating folders, manually deleting temp files can reclaim even more space.

Step-by-Step Guide: - Press Windows + R to open the Run dialog. - Type %temp% and press Enter. This opens the Temp folder. - Press Ctrl + A to select all files. - Right-click the selection and choose Delete. - If prompted that some files are in use, click Skip for those files.

Tip: Empty your Recycle Bin after deletion to permanently free up the space.

5\. Cleaning Up Web Browser Temporary Files

Browsers store cache and temporary files that can pile up. Each browser has its own process.

Example: Clearing Cache in Microsoft Edge - Open Edge and click the three-dot menu in the top right. - Select Settings > Privacy, search, and services. - Under “Clear browsing data,” click “Choose what to clear.” - Select “Cached images and files” and any other items you want to remove. - Click “Clear now.”
