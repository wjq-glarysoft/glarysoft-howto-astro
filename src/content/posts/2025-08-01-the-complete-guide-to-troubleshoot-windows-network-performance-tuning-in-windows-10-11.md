Windows network performance can be the difference between smooth productivity and frustrating delays. Whether you are experiencing slow downloads, lag in video calls, or general sluggishness when accessing network resources, this guide offers professional insights and hands-on solutions for optimizing and troubleshooting network performance in Windows 10 and 11.

Why is my Windows network slow?

Network slowdowns can be caused by several factors—misconfigured system settings, outdated drivers, excessive background processes, interference from startup programs, or even overlooked system junk. Identifying and resolving these issues can result in significant improvements.

Section 1: Beginners – Essential Network Troubleshooting Steps

Check your network connection

1\. Ensure you are connected to the correct Wi-Fi or Ethernet network. 2. Restart your modem or router if you experience sudden slowness. 3. Run the built-in Windows troubleshooter: - Go to Settings > Network & Internet > Status. - Click ‘Network troubleshooter’ and follow the prompts.

Update your network drivers

Outdated or corrupted drivers are a common cause of network issues. 1. Press Windows + X and select Device Manager. 2. Expand 'Network adapters', right-click your adapter, and choose ‘Update driver’. 3. Select ‘Search automatically for updated driver software’.

Disable background apps

Background apps often consume bandwidth. 1. Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager. 2. Go to the ‘Startup’ tab to disable unnecessary apps. 3. In the ‘Processes’ tab, monitor and end high network usage applications.

Clear system junk and temporary files

Old cache, temp files, and logs can interfere with system and network operation. Cleaning these up streamlines performance. Glary Utilities offers a ‘1-Click Maintenance’ tool that scans and removes temporary files, repairs registry issues, and clears browser traces, ensuring fewer software conflicts and smoother network operations: 1. Install and open [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com). 2. Click on ‘1-Click Maintenance’. 3. Check items related to temporary files and system cleanup. 4. Click ‘Scan for Issues’, then ‘Repair Problems’.

Section 2: Intermediate – Network Settings and Optimization

Adjust adapter properties

1\. In Device Manager, right-click your network adapter and select ‘Properties’. 2. Under the ‘Advanced’ tab, look for settings like ‘Speed & Duplex’—set this to ‘Auto Negotiation’ or match your network equipment’s speed.

Configure DNS for faster resolution

Switching to a faster DNS server can improve page loading and connectivity. 1. Go to Settings > Network & Internet > Change adapter options. 2. Right-click your connection, select ‘Properties’. 3. Select ‘Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)’ and click ‘Properties’. 4. Choose ‘Use the following DNS server addresses’ and enter: Preferred: 8.8.8.8 Alternate: 8.8.4.4

Tweak Windows QoS (Quality of Service)

Windows sometimes reserves bandwidth for system tasks. 1. Press Windows + R, type gpedit.msc, press Enter. 2. Navigate to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Network > QoS Packet Scheduler. 3. Double-click ‘Limit reservable bandwidth’, enable it, and set the limit to 0%.

Section 3: Advanced – Deep Network Performance Tuning

TCP/IP Stack Optimization

Resetting or tuning your TCP/IP stack can resolve deeper performance issues. 1. Open Command Prompt as Administrator. 2. Run these commands one by one: netsh int ip reset netsh winsock reset ipconfig /flushdns

Disable Large Send Offload (LSO)

Some network cards’ LSO feature can cause slowdowns. 1. Open Device Manager > Network adapters > Properties > Advanced tab. 2. Locate ‘Large Send Offload’ or ‘LSO’ (may appear as ‘IPv4’ or ‘IPv6’), and set it to ‘Disabled’.

Adjust Power Settings for Maximum Performance

1\. Go to Settings > System > Power & sleep > Additional power settings. 2. Select ‘High Performance’ or create a custom plan with maximum performance settings.

Monitor Real-Time Network Usage

Advanced users can use Windows Resource Monitor (type resmon in Start) or third-party apps to identify which processes are using the network. Glary Utilities’ ‘Process Manager’ also allows you to see real-time bandwidth usage and terminate problematic processes with one click.

Section 4: Maintenance – Keeping Your Network Optimized

Regularly update Windows and your drivers Use [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com)’ ‘Software Update’ to quickly check for outdated drivers and applications.

Clean system junk and optimize startup with Glary Utilities Its ‘Startup Manager’ lets you disable or delay unnecessary programs, reducing background bandwidth usage and improving boot times.

Schedule regular maintenance Set up Glary Utilities to run weekly automatic cleanups and optimize your registry, keeping network-related system files in top shape.
