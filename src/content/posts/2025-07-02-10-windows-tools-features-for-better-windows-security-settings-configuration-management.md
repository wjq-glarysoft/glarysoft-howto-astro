Whether you are new to Windows or an experienced user, understanding and properly managing security features can greatly enhance your computer’s privacy and security. This article explores ten essential Windows tools and features you should use and configure for better security, with practical advice for both beginners and advanced users.

1\. Windows Security (Windows Defender)

Here, you can: - Check for virus and threat protection updates. - Run quick or full scans for malware. - Configure real-time protection.

Action: Make sure Real-time protection is turned on and schedule regular scans.

2\. Windows Firewall

Beginner Guidance: The Windows Firewall helps block unauthorized network access. To configure: - Open Control Panel > System and Security > Windows Defender Firewall. - Click “Turn Windows Defender Firewall on or off” to ensure it’s enabled for both public and private networks.

Action: Always keep the firewall enabled, especially on public Wi-Fi.

Advanced Tips: Click “Advanced settings” to define inbound and outbound rules for specific applications or ports, ideal for restricting network access for sensitive programs.

3\. User Account Control (UAC)

Action: Avoid setting UAC to “Never notify.”

Advanced Tips: Advanced users can use Local Security Policy (secpol.msc) to fine-tune UAC behavior, such as requiring credentials for elevation.

4\. Windows Update

Beginner Guidance: Keeping Windows updated protects your system from known vulnerabilities. - Go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update. - Click “Check for updates” and enable automatic updates.

Action: Regularly reboot after updates to ensure security patches are applied.

Action: Regularly review sign-in activity and update your password.

Advanced Tips: Enable passwordless sign-in using Windows Hello or the Microsoft Authenticator app for stronger security and convenience.

Action: Disable unnecessary permissions, especially for apps you do not use.

Advanced Tips: Use “Feedback & diagnostics” to limit what diagnostic data is sent to Microsoft and examine app access histories for potential privacy leaks.

9\. Local Group Policy Editor (gpedit.msc)
