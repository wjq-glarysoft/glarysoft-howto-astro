Keeping your Windows 10 computer running smoothly often depends on the health and integrity of your system files. Corrupted or missing system files can lead to slowdowns, crashes, and frustrating errors. Fortunately, there are several reliable ways to clean, repair, and maintain Windows 10 system files—some quick and easy, others more advanced for experienced users. The following top 10 techniques will help you save time while ensuring your PC is in top shape. Whether you’re a beginner or an advanced user, there’s something here for everyone.

1\. Use Glary Utilities for One-Click System Repair (Best for Beginners)

Glary Utilities is an all-in-one maintenance tool that makes cleaning and repairing system files straightforward. Its “1-Click Maintenance” feature scans for invalid registry entries, broken shortcuts, and temporary files that may cause system issues.

How to use: - Download and install Glary Utilities. - Open the program and select “1-Click Maintenance.” - Check the boxes for “Registry Cleaner” and “Shortcuts Fixer.” - Click “Scan for Issues,” then “Repair Problems.” This process quickly addresses many common system file errors without any need for manual troubleshooting.

2\. Run the Windows System File Checker (SFC) Tool

SFC is a built-in command-line tool that scans and repairs corrupted Windows system files.

How to use: - Open the Start menu, type “cmd,” right-click on Command Prompt, and select “Run as administrator.” - Type: sfc /scannow and press Enter. - Wait as Windows scans and repairs corrupted files. This process can take 10–20 minutes, making it a quick fix for most system file problems.

3\. Use the Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool (DISM)

For deeper repairs, DISM can restore system health when SFC falls short.

How to use: - Open Command Prompt as administrator. - Type: DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth and press Enter. - Let the tool complete its repair process. DISM can download healthy system files from Microsoft’s servers, repairing even extensive corruption.

4\. Use Glary Utilities’ “Repair System Files” Module (Time-Saver for All Levels)

[Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) offers a dedicated “Repair System Files” tool that automates much of the work typically done manually. It checks for missing system files or DLLs and restores them with a single click.

Practical example: - Open Glary Utilities and go to the “Advanced Tools” tab. - Select “Repair System Files” and run the scan. - Follow the prompts to fix any discovered issues.

5\. Clear Windows Update Cache

Corrupt update files can cause system file errors or prevent repairs from taking effect.

How to clear: - Open the Start menu, type “services.msc,” and stop the “Windows Update” service. - Open File Explorer and go to C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\Download. - Delete all files in this folder. - Restart the “Windows Update” service.

6\. Restore from a System Restore Point

If recent changes caused file corruption, System Restore can return your computer to a previous, error-free state.

How to use: - Open the Start menu and type “System Restore.” - Choose “Create a restore point,” then “System Restore.” - Select a restore point from before the issues began and follow the prompts.

7\. Use Windows Startup Repair (For Advanced Users)

When Windows won’t boot or experiences severe damage, Startup Repair can identify and fix system file errors.

How to access: - Restart your PC and boot from a Windows 10 installation USB/DVD. - Select “Repair your computer.” - Choose “Troubleshoot” > “Advanced options” > “Startup Repair.”

8\. Check for Disk Errors with CHKDSK

Disk errors can corrupt system files over time. CHKDSK scans and repairs your drive.

How to use: - Open Command Prompt as administrator. - Type: chkdsk c: /f /r (replace “c” with your system drive letter). - Press Enter and follow prompts to schedule at next reboot.

9\. Manually Replace Corrupted System Files (For Experts)

If you know which file is corrupted, you can manually copy the correct version from another PC or recovery media.

How to do it: - Locate a healthy version of the file (e.g., “C:\\Windows\\System32\\file.dll”). - Use Command Prompt and the copy command to replace the corrupt file. - Restart your PC.

10\. Keep System Files Clean with Regular Maintenance

Prevention saves the most time. Regularly running tools like [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) for registry cleaning, disk cleanup, and shortcut fixer reduces the risk of system file corruption.

Recommended schedule: - Run Glary Utilities “1-Click Maintenance” weekly. - Check for Windows updates monthly. - Create regular system restore points.

Sections for Different Skill Levels

Beginner Tips: - Use Glary Utilities for basic, regular maintenance. - Run SFC and DISM via Command Prompt with copy-paste instructions. - Restore from a system restore point if issues persist.
