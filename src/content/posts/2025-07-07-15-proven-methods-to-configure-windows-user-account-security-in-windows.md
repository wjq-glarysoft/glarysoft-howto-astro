Securing your Windows user account is one of the most important steps you can take to protect your system and personal information. Windows offers a variety of tools and settings designed to help users manage privacy and security effectively. This guide presents 15 proven methods, ranging from simple changes to advanced configurations, to significantly improve your user account security.

Beginner Section: Essential User Account Security Steps

1\. Use Strong Passwords

Why is a strong password important? Weak passwords are easy to guess or crack, making your account vulnerable to unauthorized access.

How to set a strong password: - Open Settings. - Click on Accounts. - Select Sign-in options. - Under Password, select Add (or Change if you already have one). Create a password with at least 12 characters, including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.

2\. Enable Windows Hello (PIN, Face, or Fingerprint)

What is Windows Hello? Windows Hello offers secure and convenient sign-in options beyond traditional passwords.

To enable Windows Hello: - Go to Settings > Accounts > Sign-in options. - Choose Windows Hello Face, Fingerprint, or PIN, and follow the setup instructions.

3\. Create a Local Account for Everyday Use

Why use a local account? Using a local account for daily activities reduces the potential impact if your Microsoft account is compromised.

To create a local account: - Go to Settings > Accounts > Family & other users. - Click Add someone else to this PC. - Follow the prompts and select I don’t have this person’s sign-in information > Add a user without a Microsoft account.

4\. Manage Account Permissions

How to check your account type: - Go to Settings > Accounts > Your info. - Ensure your daily account is a Standard user, not an Administrator, for everyday tasks.

If you need to change account type: - Go to Settings > Accounts > Family & other users. - Click on the account, select Change account type, and choose Standard User.

5\. Use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Why use 2FA? Adding a second layer of security helps protect your account even if your password is compromised.

How to enable 2FA: - For Microsoft Accounts, visit https://account.microsoft.com/security. - Under Additional security, select Two-step verification and follow the instructions.

6\. Disable Unnecessary Administrator Accounts

Why disable unused accounts? Fewer administrator accounts mean a smaller attack surface.

How to disable: - Right-click Start, select Computer Management. - Go to Local Users and Groups > Users. - Right-click on unused accounts and select Properties, then check Account is disabled.

7\. Use Account Lockout Policies

What is an account lockout policy? Account lockout policies temporarily lock an account after several incorrect password attempts, reducing brute-force attacks.

How to configure: - Type secpol.msc in the Start menu and press Enter. - Navigate to Account Policies > Account Lockout Policy. - Set the lockout threshold (e.g., 5 invalid attempts).

8\. Turn on User Account Control (UAC)

What does UAC do? UAC notifies you when changes require administrator permission, preventing unauthorized system modifications.

To check or adjust UAC: - Type UAC in the Start menu and select Change User Account Control settings. - Set the slider to Notify me only when apps try to make changes to my computer (recommended).

9\. Regularly Review Account Activity

How to monitor activity: - Go to Settings > Accounts > Your Info > Manage my Microsoft account. - Under Security, review Recent Activity for any unusual sign-ins or changes.

10\. Enable BitLocker for User Data Protection

What is BitLocker? BitLocker encrypts your drive, protecting your data if your device is stolen.

To enable BitLocker: - Type BitLocker in the Start menu. - Select Turn on BitLocker and follow the instructions.

11\. Audit and Remove Hidden or Guest Accounts

Why audit hidden accounts? Attackers sometimes create hidden accounts to maintain access.

How to audit: - Open Command Prompt as administrator. - Type net user and press Enter. - Review the listed accounts; disable or delete any unknown or unnecessary ones using net user \[username\] /delete.

12\. Restrict Remote Desktop Access

Why restrict RDP? Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) can be exploited if not properly secured.

How to restrict: - Go to Settings > System > Remote Desktop. - Toggle off Enable Remote Desktop unless necessary. - If needed, limit user access under Select users that can remotely access this PC.

13\. Configure Group Policy for Restrictive Permissions

Why use Group Policy? Group Policy allows fine-tuned control over user permissions and security settings.

How to apply: - Press Win + R, type gpedit.msc, and press Enter. - Navigate to Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings. - Adjust policies such as Password Policy and User Rights Assignment as needed.

14\. Use Secure Sign-In (Ctrl+Alt+Del Requirement)

What is secure sign-in? Requiring Ctrl+Alt+Del before login helps thwart certain types of malware.

How to enable: - Type netplwiz in Start. - Click Advanced tab. - Check Require users to press Ctrl+Alt+Del.
