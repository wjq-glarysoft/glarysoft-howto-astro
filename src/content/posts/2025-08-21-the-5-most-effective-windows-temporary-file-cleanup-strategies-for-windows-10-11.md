Temporary files are created by Windows and applications to store short-term data. While they serve a purpose, these files can quickly accumulate and take up valuable disk space, often slowing down system performance. For users of Windows 10 and 11, regular cleanup of these files is an essential part of system maintenance. Here are the five most effective strategies to handle temporary file buildup, presented with practical steps that an intermediate Windows user can follow.

What is the built-in Disk Cleanup tool and how can it help? Disk Cleanup has been part of Windows for years and remains a reliable first step in removing unnecessary temporary files. It can delete cached files, system error reports, and temporary internet data. To use it: 1. Press the Windows key, type “Disk Cleanup,” and launch the utility. 2. Select the drive you want to clean (normally C:). 3. The tool scans and presents categories of files you can safely delete. 4. Check “Temporary files” along with other unnecessary categories like “Delivery Optimization Files” and “System error memory dump files.” 5. Click OK to confirm and start the cleanup.

Disk Cleanup can remove gigabytes of clutter, especially after a Windows update or software installation.

How effective is Storage Sense for ongoing cleanup? Windows 10 and 11 include Storage Sense, an automated feature designed to handle temporary file cleanup without manual intervention. It’s particularly useful for users who forget to run maintenance tasks regularly. To configure it: 1. Press Windows + I to open Settings. 2. Go to System > Storage. 3. Enable Storage Sense and click on “Configure Storage Sense or run it now.” 4. Choose how often Storage Sense runs (daily, weekly, or monthly). 5. Define conditions for removing temporary files, such as deleting items in the Recycle Bin after 30 days.

With Storage Sense active, Windows cleans up files automatically, preventing buildup over time.

Why should you use the Temp folder cleanup method? Not all temporary files are removed by Disk Cleanup or Storage Sense. Applications often store their temp data in specific folders that can remain untouched. Manually cleaning the Temp folder can help: 1. Press Windows + R, type %temp%, and press Enter. 2. This opens the Temp folder containing remnants from application installs, updates, and usage. 3. Press Ctrl + A to select all files, then press Delete. 4. Skip any files that are in use and cannot be deleted.

This simple manual step often clears out hundreds of megabytes of forgotten clutter.

What role does [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) play in advanced cleanup? For users looking for a more comprehensive and user-friendly solution, Glary Utilities offers powerful cleanup tools beyond what Windows provides. Its “1-Click Maintenance” feature can scan for temporary files across the system, clean up browser caches, remove leftover registry entries, and optimize startup programs in a single step. To use it: 1. Install and open [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com). 2. Navigate to “1-Click Maintenance” from the main interface. 3. Check the “Temporary Files Cleaner” option along with other relevant categories like “Tracks Eraser” or “Registry Cleaner.” 4. Run the scan and review the results before clicking “Repair Problems.”

Glary Utilities is particularly effective because it scans deeper than built-in tools, ensuring hidden file traces and software leftovers are also removed.

When should you consider advanced command-line cleanup? For advanced users who prefer precision, command-line tools provide direct control over temporary file deletion. One example is using Windows PowerShell: 1. Open PowerShell as Administrator. 2. Enter the command: Remove-Item -Path $env:TEMP\\\* -Recurse -Force 3. This command clears the contents of the Temp folder without needing manual browsing.

Experienced users may also use command-line scripting to automate cleanup tasks, scheduling them with Task Scheduler for recurring maintenance.

By combining Windows’ native tools with advanced utilities like [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com), temporary file cleanup becomes both thorough and efficient. Regular maintenance ensures smoother performance, frees up disk space, and minimizes system slowdowns over time. These five strategies give intermediate Windows users the methods they need to keep their PC running at its best.
