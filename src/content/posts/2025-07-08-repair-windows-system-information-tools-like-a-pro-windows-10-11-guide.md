Windows 10 and 11 provide a range of built-in system information tools that help users monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize their PCs. Knowing how to repair or reset these tools, and how to extract the most value from them, can make a huge difference in your system’s stability and performance. This guide explores advanced techniques for repairing and maximizing system information utilities, offering practical advice for both beginners and advanced users.

What Are Windows System Information Tools?

System information tools in Windows include utilities like System Information (msinfo32), Task Manager, Resource Monitor, and Performance Monitor. These tools display detailed info about your hardware, software, drivers, and system health, and are vital for diagnosing problems or planning upgrades. Occasionally, these tools may fail to open, display incomplete data, or show errors—knowing how to repair them is key for any Windows user.

Beginner Section: Restoring Access to System Information Tools

What If System Information Tools Don’t Open?

If you try to launch msinfo32 or Task Manager and nothing happens, start with these basic steps:

1\. Check for Updates - Open Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update. - Click “Check for updates” and install any available updates, as these can fix bugs affecting system utilities.

2\. Run System File Checker (SFC) - Press Windows key + S and type cmd. - Right-click Command Prompt and choose ‘Run as administrator.’ - Type sfc /scannow and press Enter. Wait until the scan completes and follow any repair instructions.

3\. Use DISM to Repair Windows Image - In the same Command Prompt window, type: DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth - Press Enter and wait for completion. This command repairs the Windows image, which may fix missing or broken system tools.

4\. Check Shortcuts and Permissions - Sometimes shortcuts may be broken. Navigate to C:\\Windows\\System32 and double-click msinfo32.exe or perfmon.exe directly to see if they work. - Right-click the executable > Properties > Compatibility and ensure “Run as administrator” is checked if you need elevated access.

Advanced Section: Deep Repair and Optimization

How Can Advanced Users Repair Corrupt System Information Tool Files?

If tools still fail to run, or report missing DLLs or files, try these steps:

1\. Manually Register System Files - Open Command Prompt as administrator. - To manually re-register a DLL, for example for Performance Monitor: regsvr32 perfmon.exe - Replace the filename as necessary if another tool is affected.

2\. Analyze Event Viewer Logs - Press Windows key + X, select Event Viewer. - Go to Windows Logs > Application and look for errors related to msinfo32.exe, perfmon.exe, or other tools. - Use error codes to troubleshoot further—often, searching Microsoft’s database or community forums can lead you to targeted solutions.

3\. Reset Windows Components - If SFC or DISM fail, consider resetting Windows components: - Open Settings > System > Recovery. - Select “Reset this PC” and choose “Keep my files” to reinstall Windows system files without losing your documents.

How to Optimize and Enhance System Information Tools

For regular maintenance and advanced management, a third-party system optimization suite like [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) can be indispensable:

Why Use Glary Utilities? - Glary Utilities provides a unified dashboard to monitor disk usage, RAM, startup items, and more. - Its “System Information” feature digs even deeper than built-in tools, offering details about hardware, software, device drivers, and system events. - The integrated repair tools can clean junk files, fix registry errors, and defragment disks—frequently solving issues that cause system information tools to malfunction. - For advanced users, the “Process Manager” and “Startup Manager” in [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) provide control over running processes and boot programs, complementing Windows’ native Task Manager.

Practical Example: Using Glary Utilities to Restore System Stability

1\. Download and install Glary Utilities from the official website. 2. Launch the program and select ‘1-Click Maintenance.’ 3. Review the list of issues found—such as registry errors or broken shortcuts that might hinder system tool operation. 4. Click ‘Repair Problems’ to automatically fix detected issues. 5. For more detail, open ‘Advanced Tools’ > ‘System Information’ to audit hardware and software status, confirming your tools now function as expected.

Tips for Ongoing Maintenance

\- Schedule regular scans with Glary Utilities or Windows built-in tools to keep your system healthy. - After major Windows updates, rerun SFC and DISM to catch any new problems early. - Use Task Manager’s “Startup” tab (or Glary’s “Startup Manager”) to disable unnecessary programs that could slow down or conflict with system info utilities.

Final Advice for All Users

Keeping your system information tools healthy is a must for both troubleshooting and optimizing your Windows experience. Beginners should start with built-in repair commands and updates; advanced users can dive deep into manual fixes and leverage third-party utilities like Glary Utilities for comprehensive management.

Whether you’re diagnosing hardware issues, planning upgrades, or just keeping your system running smoothly, these techniques will help you repair and enhance Windows system information tools like a pro.
