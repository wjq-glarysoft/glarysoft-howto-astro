Windows 11 continues the tradition of powerful command line utilities, offering users, from beginners to experts, a suite of tools to manage, troubleshoot, and optimize their PCs. Whether you're looking to automate maintenance, diagnose system issues, or clean up your computer, understanding the most effective command line tools can save time and boost your system’s performance. This article breaks down the best command line methods in Windows 11, provides clear step-by-step instructions, and offers practical examples for everyday scenarios.

What Are the Essential Windows 11 Command Line Tools?

Windows 11 includes familiar tools such as Command Prompt (cmd), PowerShell, and the Windows Terminal. Each provides access to a range of commands that can help keep your system running smoothly. Here’s a look at some key tools and why they matter:

\- Command Prompt (cmd): The classic Windows terminal for executing system commands. - PowerShell: A more advanced shell for scripting and deeper system management. - Windows Terminal: A modern interface that can host Command Prompt, PowerShell, and other shells in tabs.

How to Access Command Line Tools in Windows 11?

1\. Press the Windows Key and type "cmd" for Command Prompt or "powershell" for PowerShell. 2. Right-click your choice and select "Run as administrator" when higher privileges are needed. 3. For Windows Terminal, type "terminal" in the Start Menu and select it.

Which Command Line Methods Can Optimize and Maintain Windows 11?

Let’s explore practical uses for command line tools, with real-world examples and easy-to-follow steps.

1\. System File Checker (SFC) for Repairing System Files

Corrupted system files can cause crashes and errors. SFC scans and fixes these automatically.

\- Open Command Prompt as administrator. - Type: sfc /scannow - Press Enter. - Wait for the scan to finish. If issues are found, SFC will attempt to repair them.

2\. Using DISM to Fix Windows Image Issues

If SFC doesn’t resolve your problems, Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) digs deeper.

\- Open Command Prompt as administrator. - Type: DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth - Press Enter. - Let the scan run. DISM retrieves fresh files from Windows Update if needed.

3\. Cleaning Up Disk Space with Cleanmgr and Storage Sense

While Cleanmgr is a graphical tool, you can use it from the command line for automated cleanup.

\- Open Command Prompt. - Type: cleanmgr /sageset:1 - Configure the cleanup options in the window that pops up. - Then run: cleanmgr /sagerun:1

For more advanced cleanup, Glary Utilities offers an even more thorough solution, combining multiple maintenance tasks like registry cleaning, temporary file removal, and startup optimization—all from one interface.

4\. Managing Startup Programs with WMIC and PowerShell

Keeping unnecessary programs from launching at startup boosts boot time.

View startup applications: - Open PowerShell. - Type: Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32\_StartupCommand | Select-Object Name, Command

Disable unwanted startup items with Task Manager for a GUI option, or use [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com)’ Startup Manager for more detailed control and safer management.

5\. Monitoring System Performance with Tasklist and Taskkill

To find and close resource-hogging processes:

List running tasks: - Open Command Prompt. - Type: tasklist

Kill a process: - Type: taskkill /IM processname.exe /F (Replace “processname.exe” with the actual name from tasklist.)

6\. Checking Disk Health with Chkdsk

Bad sectors and file system errors can slow your PC or cause data loss.

\- Open Command Prompt as administrator. - Type: chkdsk C: /f /r - If prompted to schedule on next restart, type Y and restart your PC.

7\. Network Troubleshooting with Ipconfig and Ping

Identify and fix network issues:

\- View network settings: ipconfig /all - Release and renew IP: ipconfig /release then ipconfig /renew - Check connectivity: ping www.google.com

How Does Glary Utilities Complement Command Line Tools?

While command line tools are powerful, they require manual input and knowledge of each command. [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) provides a user-friendly alternative or companion, bringing together disk cleanup, registry repair, startup management, and more in a single dashboard. It can automate routine maintenance, schedule cleanups, and present system health reports—ideal for users wanting robust results without memorizing commands.

Which Method Should You Use?

For everyday tasks like checking system health, cleaning up files, or troubleshooting, command line tools offer speed and precision. For more comprehensive maintenance and scheduled optimization, augment these tools with Glary Utilities.

Final Tips for All Windows Users

\- Always run critical commands as an administrator for full effect. - Back up important data before running repair or cleanup utilities. - Combine command line methods with tools like Glary Utilities for best results.

Mastering these command line tools and supplementing them with comprehensive utilities will help you maintain, optimize, and troubleshoot your Windows 11 PC effectively, regardless of your experience level.
