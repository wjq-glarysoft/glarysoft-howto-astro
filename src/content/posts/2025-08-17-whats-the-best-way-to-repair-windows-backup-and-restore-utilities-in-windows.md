Windows Backup and Restore is a built-in tool designed to help users create backups of files and system images. However, this utility can sometimes malfunction, displaying errors, failing to run scheduled backups, or refusing to restore files properly. Repairing the Backup and Restore utility requires a careful approach using Windows’ own system tools and proven troubleshooting methods. Below is a step-by-step tutorial aimed at both beginners and advanced users.

Understanding the Problem Before jumping into fixes, it’s important to identify common issues with Backup and Restore: - Scheduled backups not running. - Error codes such as 0x80070002, 0x81000037, or disk not found messages. - Backup freezes in the middle of the process. - Restore points missing or corrupted.

By understanding the cause, you can apply the right repair step without unnecessary trial and error.

Step-by-Step Repairs for Beginners

1\. Check Windows Services Backup and Restore depends on several Windows services. If these are disabled, the utility may fail. - Press Windows + R, type services.msc, and press Enter. - Locate these services: Windows Backup, Volume Shadow Copy, and Task Scheduler. - Double-click each one and ensure the Startup type is set to Automatic. Click Start if the service is stopped.

Example: If Volume Shadow Copy is disabled, backups cannot create snapshots of files, leading to incomplete or failed backups.

2\. Run the System File Checker Corrupted system files can prevent Backup and Restore from functioning correctly. - Open Command Prompt as Administrator. - Type sfc /scannow and press Enter. - Allow the scan to complete and follow on-screen repair instructions.

3\. Clear Old Backup Data Sometimes, corrupted old backups prevent new ones from being created. - Open Control Panel. - Go to Backup and Restore. - Select Manage Space. - Delete older or unsuccessful backup sets.

4\. Use Glary Utilities for System Cleanup [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) can free up space, fix registry errors, and remove junk files that interfere with backups. - Install and open [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com). - Run 1-Click Maintenance to clean up temporary files and repair registry issues. - Use the Disk Repair tool inside Glary Utilities to check for file system errors that may cause backup failures.

This combination ensures Windows Backup is not fighting against cluttered or corrupted system files.

Advanced Repair Steps for Experienced Users

1\. Use DISM to Repair Windows Image If SFC fails to resolve errors, use the Deployment Imaging and Servicing Management tool: - Open Command Prompt as Administrator. - Type DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth and press Enter. - Once complete, reboot the system and re-run sfc /scannow.

2\. Check Event Viewer Logs Event Viewer provides detailed system logs that identify why Backup and Restore failed. - Press Windows + R, type eventvwr.msc, and press Enter. - Navigate to Windows Logs > Application and look for Backup-related error messages. - Use the error code or description to narrow down the cause, such as disk write errors or insufficient permissions.

3\. Re-register Backup Components Sometimes, the Backup and Restore DLLs become unregistered. - Open Command Prompt as Administrator. - Run commands like regsvr32 vss\_ps.dll and regsvr32 swprv.dll to re-register Volume Shadow Copy components. - Restart the system and try running Backup again.

4\. Perform a Disk Check Disk problems often prevent backups from completing. - Open Command Prompt as Administrator. - Type chkdsk C: /f /r and press Enter. - Schedule the scan and restart the PC.

5\. Create a Fresh Backup Schedule Corrupted task scheduler entries can block backups. - Open Control Panel > Backup and Restore. - Delete the current schedule. - Set up a new backup with updated parameters.

Practical Example Imagine a user encounters error code 0x81000037 when trying to back up files. By checking Event Viewer, they discover the issue is tied to a disconnected external drive. After removing references to the missing drive and creating a new backup plan with a different disk, the backup completes successfully. Running [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) beforehand helps clean out leftover configurations that could re-trigger the error.

Conclusion Repairing Windows Backup and Restore utilities is a matter of combining built-in tools like Services, SFC, DISM, and Event Viewer with cleanup utilities like Glary Utilities. Beginners can focus on checking services, clearing old data, and running cleanup scans, while advanced users can dive into system logs, re-register components, and repair system images. By following these structured steps, Windows Backup and Restore can be restored to reliable operation.
