Junk files accumulate quickly on Windows PCs, slowing down performance and wasting disk space. Advanced junk file removal strategies can make a significant difference in maintaining system health and speed. While third-party tools like Glary Utilities offer comprehensive solutions, Windows itself includes several built-in features that, when used effectively, greatly improve junk file management. This article explores seven powerful built-in features for junk file cleanup, offering practical advice for both beginners and advanced users.

Understanding Junk Files on Windows

Junk files are unnecessary or temporary files created by Windows and other programs. These can include temporary system files, leftover update files, browser cache, error logs, and more. Over time, these files pile up and can lead to performance issues if not managed regularly.

1\. Storage Sense

Beginners: Storage Sense is a built-in Windows feature that automatically frees up space by deleting temporary files and content from the Recycle Bin.

How to Use: - Go to Settings > System > Storage. - Toggle Storage Sense to “On.” - Click “Configure Storage Sense or run it now.” - Select cleanup frequency and the type of files to remove (e.g., temporary files, downloads).

Advanced Users: Configure Storage Sense to aggressively manage temporary files, schedule automatic runs during system idle time, and set exceptions for critical directories.

2\. Disk Cleanup Utility

Beginners: Disk Cleanup is a straightforward tool for deleting system-generated junk files.

How to Use: - Search for “Disk Cleanup” from the Start menu and open it. - Select the drive to clean (usually C:). - Check the boxes for file types to delete (e.g., Temporary files, Thumbnails, System created Windows Error Reporting). - Click “OK” and confirm deletion.

Advanced Users: Run Disk Cleanup as an administrator to access “Clean up system files,” which allows removal of old Windows update files, system restore points, and more.

3\. Temporary Files Cleanup via Settings

Beginners: Windows allows direct removal of temporary files through the Settings app.

How to Use: - Go to Settings > System > Storage > Temporary files. - Review and select categories (e.g., Windows Update Cleanup, Delivery Optimization Files). - Click “Remove files.”

Advanced Users: Script the cleanup process using PowerShell or automate it with Task Scheduler for regular maintenance.

4\. Windows Update Cleanup

Beginners: Old Windows Update files can take up gigabytes of space.

How to Use: - Run Disk Cleanup as administrator. - Select “Windows Update Cleanup.”

Advanced Users: Use PowerShell commands to clear the Windows Update cache for more granular control or to resolve update errors.

5\. Prefetch and Superfetch Data Management

Beginners: These system files help with app launching but can become bloated.

How to Use: - Navigate to C:\\Windows\\Prefetch. - Delete files in this folder to free up space (Windows will rebuild as needed).

Advanced Users: Disable Superfetch (SysMain) via services.msc for SSDs or script regular cleanups for high-use PCs.

6\. Browser Cache and Temporary Internet Files

Beginners: Browsers store cache data that can be purged from within their settings.

How to Use (Example with Edge): - Click the three dots > Settings > Privacy, search, and services. - Under “Clear browsing data,” click “Choose what to clear.”

Advanced Users: Use browser group policies or command-line tools to automate cache cleanup across multiple user accounts or systems.

7\. System Restore and Shadow Copies Management

Beginners: System Restore points can consume significant disk space over time.

How to Use: - Right-click “This PC” > Properties > System Protection. - Click “Configure” under Protection Settings. - Adjust disk space usage or delete old restore points.

Advanced Users: Use “vssadmin” in Command Prompt to list and delete shadow copies, or configure retention policies for enterprise-level management.
