Are you noticing slow file transfers, laggy streaming, or dropped connections on your Windows 11 PC? Network performance issues can be frustrating, but with the right approach, you can optimize your Windows 11 network settings to achieve faster, more reliable connections. This guide covers straightforward, time-saving tips for intermediate users who want to get the most from their network without unnecessary complexity. Let’s dive in.

Why Should You Tune Windows 11 Network Performance?

Optimizing your network settings isn’t just about raw speed. It can improve online gaming, decrease buffering when streaming, shorten file transfer times, and reduce interruptions during video calls. Tuning ensures you’re making the most of your available bandwidth and hardware capabilities.

Which Settings Can Give You the Quickest Wins?

Speed up your optimization process by targeting settings that make an immediate difference. Here are the best places to start:

Check Network Adapter Drivers

Outdated drivers are a common cause of sluggish network performance.

1\. Right-click the Start button and select Device Manager. 2. Expand Network adapters, right-click your adapter, and choose Update driver. 3. Select Search automatically for drivers.

If Windows doesn’t find anything, check your manufacturer’s website for the latest version. Updated drivers can resolve compatibility issues and enable new features, often boosting speeds with minimal effort.

Disable Unnecessary Startup Programs

Background applications can hog bandwidth, especially sync tools and cloud services.

1\. Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager. 2. Go to the Startup tab. 3. Right-click on unnecessary programs and select Disable.

This stops them from launching automatically and consuming network resources at startup.

Optimize Windows Network Settings

Windows 11 provides several built-in options for network tuning:

1\. Press Win + I to open Settings. 2. Go to Network & Internet > Advanced network settings. 3. Click on Network reset and follow the prompts to reset your network adapters. This clears out old settings that might be hampering performance.

For further tweaking:

1\. From Advanced network settings, select your primary adapter. 2. Click View additional properties. 3. Set DNS assignment to Manual, then enter preferred DNS servers like 1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1 (Cloudflare) or 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 (Google). Faster DNS servers can noticeably reduce website loading times.

Prioritize Network Traffic with QoS

If your router supports Quality of Service (QoS), you can prioritize specific devices or applications for the best performance during demanding tasks. Check your router’s documentation for setup instructions. In Windows, you can also:

1\. Open Settings > Network & Internet > Wi-Fi (or Ethernet). 2. Select Hardware properties and look for settings related to packet scheduling or prioritization (availability depends on adapter and driver support).

Clean Up with [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com)

Network issues are often compounded by junk files, outdated caches, or fragmented registries that slow your PC’s overall response.

Glary Utilities is an all-in-one solution for optimizing your Windows 11 performance. Here’s how it can help:

1\. Download and install Glary Utilities. 2. Open the program and select the 1-Click Maintenance tab. 3. Make sure options like Registry Cleaner, Shortcuts Fixer, and Temporary Files Cleaner are checked. 4. Click Scan for Issues, then Repair Problems.

[Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) also offers a Startup Manager to further trim unnecessary background network activity, and a Privacy Cleaner to clear browser caches that can slow your network experience.

How Can You Test Network Performance Changes Quickly?

After applying changes, test your network to measure improvements:

\- Use websites like speedtest.net to measure upload and download speeds. - Try transferring a large file across your local network and time the process. - Stream high-definition videos and monitor for buffering or dropouts.

If you spot improvements, you know your tweaks are working.

Should You Adjust Advanced TCP/IP Settings?

For most users, Windows 11 auto-manages advanced TCP/IP features like auto-tuning level and RSS (Receive Side Scaling). Tuning these manually can yield gains on high-speed connections, but only if you’re comfortable with the command line:

1\. Open Command Prompt as Administrator. 2. To check auto-tuning status, run: netsh interface tcp show global 3. To enable optimal settings, run: netsh interface tcp set global autotuninglevel=normal

If you encounter issues, revert by setting autotuninglevel=disabled.

What About Security Settings and Firewalls?

Security software can sometimes throttle your network. Ensure Windows Defender Firewall is not set to overly restrictive settings, and avoid running multiple third-party firewalls simultaneously.

1\. Go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Windows Security > Firewall & network protection. 2. Ensure your active network has firewall enabled, but not in a mode that blocks legitimate traffic.

When Should You Consider Hardware Upgrades?

If, after all software tweaks, your network still underperforms, consider:

\- Upgrading to Wi-Fi 6 or a faster Ethernet adapter. - Using high-quality, shielded network cables. - Placing your router in a more central location.

Summary

By following these practical steps, you can quickly improve your Windows 11 network performance without diving into overly technical territory. Regular maintenance with tools like [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com), combined with careful attention to drivers, startup programs, and network settings, will keep things running smoothly—saving you time and frustration every day.
