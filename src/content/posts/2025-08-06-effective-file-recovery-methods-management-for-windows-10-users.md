Managing and recovering deleted or lost files is a critical skill for every Windows 10 user. Whether files are lost due to accidental deletion, drive formatting, or system errors, knowing the advanced techniques for file recovery can save valuable data and time. This article explores practical file recovery methods, real-world examples, and steps you can take using both built-in and advanced tools. We will also discuss how [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) can play a role in preventive file management and recovery assistance.

Why Does File Loss Happen on Windows 10?

Files can go missing due to various reasons: - Accidental deletion or shift+delete (bypassing Recycle Bin) - Emptying the Recycle Bin - File system corruption or bad sectors - Malware attacks or ransomware - Sudden power outages or hardware failure - Formatting or partition errors

The most important rule: Stop using the affected drive immediately to avoid overwriting lost data.

File Recovery Methods for Beginners

Can You Use the Recycle Bin?

For most accidental deletions, the first step is to check the Recycle Bin. 1. Double-click the Recycle Bin icon on your desktop. 2. Browse for your deleted file or folder. 3. Right-click and select Restore.

What if the File Isn’t in the Recycle Bin?

Try Windows 10’s built-in “File History” feature: 1. Open the folder where your file was located. 2. Right-click and select "Restore previous versions." 3. Browse and choose the version you want to restore.

Note: File History must be enabled in advance to use this feature.

File Recovery Methods for Advanced Users

How Can You Recover Files with Command Prompt?

If the file system is corrupted, files may still be present but inaccessible.

1\. Press Win+X and select Windows PowerShell (Admin) or Command Prompt (Admin). 2. Run: chkdsk X: /f (replace X: with your drive letter). This checks and fixes file system errors. 3. For recovering hidden files, use: attrib -h -r -s /s /d X:\\\*.\*

Can You Use Windows File Recovery Tool?

Microsoft offers a command-line tool called “Windows File Recovery” from the Microsoft Store.

1\. Download and install Windows File Recovery. 2. Open it as administrator. 3. Use the command: winfr source-drive: destination-drive: /regular /n \\path\\to\\file Example: winfr C: D: /regular /n \\Users\\YourName\\Documents\\report.docx

This tool recovers deleted files from local hard drives, SSDs, and USB drives. It offers different recovery modes, such as Regular, Extensive, and Segment, depending on the file system and scenario.

Advanced Third-Party File Recovery Tools

Sometimes, professional-grade recovery software is required for complex scenarios (formatted drives, partitions lost, severe corruption). Popular examples include: - Recuva - EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard - MiniTool Power Data Recovery

These tools offer deep scans and support a wide variety of file types. They can reconstruct lost partitions and rescue data from RAW or inaccessible drives.

How to Use Glary Utilities for File Management and Recovery Assistance
