For advanced Windows users, securing your system goes well beyond the basics. Windows 10 and 11 offer a range of powerful security features that, when configured properly, can drastically reduce your vulnerability to cyber threats. This guide explores advanced methods for configuring your Windows security settings, prioritizing privacy and protection without sacrificing system functionality.

1\. How Do You Harden Windows Firewall Beyond Defaults?

By default, Windows Defender Firewall offers solid protection, but advanced users can go further. Launch Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security (\`wf.msc\`). Here, create inbound and outbound rules tailored to your needs.

Example: Block all outbound connections by default, then whitelist only trusted applications and required services. This approach will prevent unauthorized software from phoning home or leaking sensitive data.

2\. How Can You Fine-Tune User Account Control (UAC)?

UAC prevents unauthorized changes, but advanced users may want greater control.

Open Local Security Policy (\`secpol.msc\`) and navigate to Local Policies > Security Options. Adjust the settings for “User Account Control: Behavior of the elevation prompt for administrators.” Choose “Prompt for credentials on the secure desktop” for maximum security, which forces credential re-entry and thwarts malware attempting to hijack the prompt.

3\. What Group Policy Changes Enhance Security?

Group Policy Editor (\`gpedit.msc\`) offers granular control. For example:

\- Enforce password complexity and minimum length (Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Account Policies). - Disable legacy protocols like SMBv1 (Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Network > Lanman Workstation). - Prevent access to Control Panel and Settings for standard users to avoid accidental configuration changes.

4\. How Can You Secure PowerShell and Scripting Environments?

Restrict PowerShell execution policy to prevent running unsigned scripts:

Open PowerShell as administrator and run: \`Set-ExecutionPolicy AllSigned -Scope LocalMachine\`

Additionally, use AppLocker or Software Restriction Policies via Group Policy to whitelist only trusted scripts and applications.

5\. How Do You Configure BitLocker for Maximum Protection?

Enable BitLocker Drive Encryption via Control Panel or Settings. For higher security:

\- Use the Group Policy Editor to set encryption strength to 256-bit AES (Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > BitLocker Drive Encryption). - Require PIN or USB startup key for pre-boot authentication. - Store recovery keys securely offline.

6\. How Can You Audit File and Folder Access?

Enable object access auditing in Local Security Policy (Local Policies > Audit Policy > Audit object access). Then, use the Security tab in file/folder properties to configure auditing for specific users or groups. This setup logs all access attempts, allowing you to spot unauthorized activity.

7\. What Are The Best Practices for Windows Defender Advanced Configurations?

Open Windows Security > Virus & Threat Protection > Manage Settings.

\- Turn on “Tamper Protection” to prevent changes by malware. - Enable “Controlled Folder Access” to protect sensitive data from ransomware. - Use PowerShell to enable features like real-time monitoring and cloud-delivered protection: \`Set-MpPreference -EnableControlledFolderAccess Enabled\` \`Set-MpPreference -MAPSReporting Advanced\`

8\. How Can You Isolate Untrusted Applications with Windows Sandbox and Application Guard?

Use Windows Sandbox for testing unknown software in an isolated environment. For browser security, enable Microsoft Defender Application Guard (Enterprise/Education editions), which isolates Edge browser sessions from your main OS.

To enable Application Guard, go to Windows Features and check “Windows Defender Application Guard,” then configure policies in Group Policy Editor.

9\. How Do You Restrict Remote Access Services?

Disable Remote Desktop if not required. If you must use it:

\- Change the default RDP port in the registry (\`HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal Server\\WinStations\\RDP-Tcp\\PortNumber\`). - Require Network Level Authentication (System Properties > Remote > Allow connections only from computers running Remote Desktop with NLA). - Limit RDP users via Local Users and Groups.

10\. How Can You Audit and Remove Privacy Risks with Glary Utilities?

Even advanced Windows configurations leave traces and redundant data. Glary Utilities offers customizable privacy and security tools:

\- Use “Tracks Eraser” to remove browser history, temporary files, and Windows usage traces. - Employ “File Shredder” for permanent deletion of sensitive files. - Schedule regular scans with “1-Click Maintenance” to clean up privacy risks and optimize system health.
