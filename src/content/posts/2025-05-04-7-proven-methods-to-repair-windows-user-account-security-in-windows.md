In today's digital age, ensuring your Windows user account is secure is more crucial than ever. This article outlines seven proven methods to repair and enhance user account security on Windows, catering to both beginners and advanced users.

What Are User Accounts and Why Secure Them?

User accounts on Windows serve as personalized profiles that maintain individual settings, files, and privileges. Securing these accounts is vital to protect sensitive information, prevent unauthorized access, and maintain overall system integrity.

Method 1: Use Strong Passwords and Update Regularly

Beginners: Start by setting a strong password for your account. A strong password should be at least eight characters long, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. To update your password, go to Settings > Accounts > Sign-in options, and follow the instructions to change your password.

Advanced Users: Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords securely. Tools like LastPass or Bitwarden can automatically fill in credentials and ensure you use unique passwords for different accounts.

Method 2: Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Beginners: Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security. Enable it by accessing your Microsoft account online, navigating to Security > More security options, and following the instructions to set up 2FA using your phone number or an authentication app.

Advanced Users: For local accounts, use third-party tools like Authy or Google Authenticator, integrating them with Windows login processes to enhance security beyond just a password.

Method 3: Regularly Monitor Account Activity

Beginners: Windows provides built-in tools to monitor account activity. Access the Event Viewer by typing "Event Viewer" in the search bar. Navigate to Windows Logs > Security to view login attempts and activity.

Advanced Users: Utilize PowerShell scripts to automate the extraction and analysis of security logs, setting up alerts for suspicious activity like multiple failed login attempts or unauthorized access.

Method 4: Adjust User Account Control (UAC) Settings

Beginners: User Account Control (UAC) helps prevent unauthorized changes. Go to Control Panel > User Accounts > Change User Account Control settings. Adjust the slider for the desired level of notification about changes to your computer.

Advanced Users: For enhanced control, modify UAC via the registry editor. Run "regedit" and navigate to HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System. Here, you can tweak advanced settings like "EnableLUA" to fine-tune security policies.

Method 5: Regularly Update Windows and Software

Beginners: Ensure your system and applications are up-to-date. Go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update, then click "Check for updates." Enable automatic updates for ongoing security patching.

Advanced Users: Use scripting tools to automate updates for third-party applications. Windows Task Scheduler can automate checks and installations of updates, ensuring all software remains secure.

Method 6: Implement Least Privilege Principles

Beginners: Limit the number of administrative accounts. Use a standard account for daily tasks, reserving administrative access for system changes. Create or modify accounts in Settings > Accounts > Family & other users.

Advanced Users: Deploy Group Policy Editor to enforce least privilege on networked systems. Configure user rights assignments and security options to restrict administrative powers strictly to necessary personnel or tasks.

Method 7: Use [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) for System Maintenance

Beginners: Glary Utilities offers a user-friendly interface for system maintenance, including privacy and security tools. Download and install [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com), then use its "1-Click Maintenance" feature to clean up and optimize system performance, enhancing overall security.

Advanced Users: Utilize Glary Utilities' advanced tools like the "Spyware Remover" and "Startup Manager" to identify potential threats and optimize startup processes. This software can automate cleanup tasks, offering deep insights into system vulnerabilities.

In Summary

Securing your Windows user account is a multifaceted task that requires consistent effort and the use of various tools and practices.
