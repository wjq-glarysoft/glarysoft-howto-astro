Windows 11 brings a sleek interface and productivity improvements, but it also collects a significant amount of user data by default. Whether you’re a privacy-conscious home user or a professional safeguarding sensitive information, enhancing your system’s privacy settings is essential. This guide presents the 15 most effective strategies to bolster your privacy on Windows 11, with clear steps for both beginners and advanced users.

Why does privacy matter in Windows 11?

Windows 11 collects telemetry data, uses personalized ads, and synchronizes settings to the cloud. While these features can improve user experience, they may compromise your privacy. Strengthening privacy not only protects your personal and professional data but also reduces unnecessary data transfers, making your PC safer and often faster.

1\. Adjust Privacy Settings During Setup

For Beginners: When setting up Windows 11, look for options related to privacy and customize them. Decline requests for location tracking, personalized ads, and diagnostic data sharing.

For Advanced Users: After setup, open Settings > Privacy & security. Review each category and disable unnecessary data collection features.

2\. Limit Diagnostic Data Collection

For Beginners: Go to Settings > Privacy & security > Diagnostics & feedback. Select "Required diagnostic data" and disable optional data sharing.

For Advanced Users: Use Group Policy Editor (Windows 11 Pro): Run gpedit.msc. Navigate to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Data Collection and Preview Builds. Set "Allow Telemetry" to "Disabled".

3\. Turn Off Activity History

For Beginners: Settings > Privacy & security > Activity history. Uncheck “Store my activity history on this device” and “Send my activity history to Microsoft”.

For Advanced Users: Clear existing activity history from the same menu.

4\. Disable Location Services

For Beginners: Settings > Privacy & security > Location. Turn off location services for the device and fine-tune app access.

For Advanced Users: Use Group Policy Editor to enforce global location privacy settings across all users.

5\. Control Microphone and Camera Access

For Beginners: Settings > Privacy & security > Camera and Microphone. Toggle off access for apps that do not require these permissions.

For Advanced Users: Review per-app permissions and disable access for built-in system apps if not needed.

6\. Manage App Permissions

For Beginners: Under Privacy & security, review each permissions category (contacts, calendar, call history, etc.) and disable access for non-essential apps.

For Advanced Users: Uninstall unnecessary apps using PowerShell: Get-AppxPackage \*appname\* | Remove-AppxPackage

7\. Disable Advertising ID and Personalized Ads

For Beginners: Settings > Privacy & security > General. Turn off “Let apps show me personalized ads by using my advertising ID”.

For Advanced Users: Block ad tracking in your browser and consider browser privacy extensions.

8\. Limit Syncing of Data with Microsoft Account

For Beginners: Settings > Accounts > Windows backup. Turn off “Remember my apps” and “Remember my preferences”.

For Advanced Users: Use a local account instead of a Microsoft account for login.

9\. Use Glary Utilities for Privacy Cleanup

For Beginners: Download and install [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com). Use the “Tracks Eraser” tool to remove browsing and usage history, temporary files, and leftover system traces.

10\. Harden Windows Defender and Security Features

For Beginners: Settings > Privacy & security > Windows Security. Run “Device Security” and “App & browser control” to maximize protection.
