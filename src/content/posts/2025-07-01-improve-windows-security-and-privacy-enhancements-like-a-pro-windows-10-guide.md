Windows 10 offers a robust set of security and privacy controls, but many of the most powerful features are hidden beneath the surface. Advanced users can significantly upgrade their security posture and keep personal data private by employing techniques beyond the basics. This guide provides detailed, practical advice for advanced users looking to maximize privacy and security in Windows 10.

How Can You Harden Windows 10 Beyond Default Settings?

Hardening Windows 10 means reducing its attack surface. Go beyond Windows Defender defaults by:

\- Enabling Controlled Folder Access: Open Windows Security > Virus & Threat Protection > Manage ransomware protection. Activate Controlled Folder Access to block untrusted apps from modifying sensitive files. - Disabling Unnecessary Windows Features: Search for "Windows Features", then turn off components you do not need, such as SMB 1.0, Internet Explorer, or legacy .NET frameworks. - Enforcing Secure Boot and TPM: Check BIOS/UEFI for Secure Boot and TPM 2.0 settings. These prevent rootkits and ensure only trusted OS components load. - Creating Standard User Accounts: Limit admin access by using a non-admin account for daily work and only switching to administrator for system changes.

What Group Policy and Registry Tweaks Enhance Privacy?

Advanced users can enforce stricter privacy and security using Group Policy Editor (gpedit.msc) and the Registry Editor (regedit.exe):

\- Limit Telemetry: Open Group Policy Editor > Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Data Collection and Preview Builds. Set "Allow Telemetry" to 0 (Security). For Home editions, use the registry: HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\DataCollection, set AllowTelemetry to 0. - Restrict Cortana: In Group Policy, disable "Allow Cortana" under Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Search. - Block Advertising ID: Registry path HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\AdvertisingInfo, set Enabled to 0. - Harden SMB Protocols: Disable SMBv1 protocol via Group Policy or PowerShell (\`Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName SMB1Protocol\`). - Enforce Network Level Authentication for Remote Desktop: In Group Policy > Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Remote Desktop Services > Remote Desktop Session Host > Security, enable "Require user authentication for remote connections by using Network Level Authentication".

Which Built-in Security Tools Should You Leverage?

Windows 10 integrates several advanced security tools. For enhanced protection:

\- Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC): Define rules to control which applications and drivers can run. Use PowerShell and policies to create allow/deny lists. - BitLocker Drive Encryption: Encrypt all drives, including external USB devices. Use Group Policy to enforce 256-bit encryption and PIN/password policies. - Windows Sandbox: For testing unsafe files, launch Windows Sandbox from the Start menu (available in Pro/Enterprise). - Credential Guard and Device Guard: Use virtualization-based security features to protect credentials and enforce strict application access.

How Can You Enhance Browser and Network Security?

\- Microsoft Edge Security Baselines: Download and apply Edge security baselines from Microsoft’s Security Compliance Toolkit. - DNS over HTTPS (DoH): Enable DoH in Edge or Firefox for encrypted DNS. In Windows settings: Network & Internet > Change Adapter Options > Select Adapter > Properties > Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) > Use the following DNS server addresses (choose providers supporting DoH, like Cloudflare 1.1.1.1). - Strong Firewall Rules: Use Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security to manually create inbound/outbound rules for sensitive applications. - Configure and Use VPN: Prefer a modern, strong VPN protocol (WireGuard or IKEv2/IPsec) for Wi-Fi and public networks.

How Do You Audit and Monitor System Security?

Security isn’t a set-and-forget process. Advanced users benefit from regular auditing:

\- Enable Security Auditing: In Group Policy, configure auditing policies for logon events, object access, and process tracking. - Review Security and Event Logs: Use Event Viewer to watch for unauthorized access attempts, privilege escalations, or system changes. - Use Sysinternals Suite: Tools like Process Explorer, Autoruns, and TCPView provide deep insight into running processes, startup items, and network connections.

What Role Does [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) Play in Windows Security and Privacy?

For advanced users, [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) complements built-in Windows tools by simplifying cleanup and maintenance:

\- Secure File Deletion: Use Glary’s File Shredder to securely erase sensitive files, ensuring they are unrecoverable. - Privacy Cleaner: Remove browser histories, cookies, and system logs that could leak information to unauthorized parties. - Startup Manager: Identify and disable unnecessary or suspicious auto-start entries that may introduce vulnerabilities. - Tracks Eraser: [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) can wipe traces of activities, enhancing privacy especially after working with confidential data.

How Do You Maintain Ongoing Security and Privacy?

\- Keep Windows and all software updated. Use Windows Update and Glary Utilities’ Software Update to catch missing patches. - Regularly review all privacy and security settings, especially after major Windows updates. - Backup regularly using BitLocker-encrypted drives and verify restore procedures.

Conclusion

Advanced Windows 10 users have a comprehensive array of tools and techniques for maximizing security and privacy. By combining system-level hardening, precise Group Policy and Registry tweaks, regular audits, and complementary tools like Glary Utilities, you can transform Windows 10 into a highly secure and private platform. Stay informed about emerging threats and update your defenses as needed to keep your system protected.
