File sharing is a fundamental part of using Windows, whether you’re collaborating in a home office, sharing music with roommates, or managing data across a business network. Managing file and folder permissions correctly ensures both accessibility and security. This guide provides 12 practical tips, ranging from beginner basics to advanced configurations, to help you confidently manage file sharing and permissions in Windows.

Section 1: For Beginners

1\. What Is File Sharing in Windows?

File sharing lets you give other users access to files or folders across your network or between user accounts on the same computer. Windows offers simple sharing wizards to make this process easy.

2\. How to Share a Folder on Your Local Network

Right-click the folder you wish to share and select “Properties.” Go to the “Sharing” tab. Click “Share.” Choose the user(s) or type “Everyone” to share with all network users, then click “Add.” Set the permission level (Read or Read/Write). Click “Share,” then “Done.” This method keeps the process simple and is ideal for sharing documents or media at home.

3\. Understanding Basic Permission Levels

Read: Allows users to view files, but not modify or delete them. Read/Write: Users can view, modify, and delete files. Be cautious with Read/Write—only grant it to trusted users.

4\. How Do I Stop Sharing a Folder?

Right-click the shared folder, go to “Properties,” and under the “Sharing” tab, click “Advanced Sharing.” Uncheck “Share this folder,” then click OK. This instantly revokes network access to the folder.

5\. What Are NTFS Permissions and How Are They Different?

NTFS permissions offer fine-grained control over who can access, modify, or delete files. They apply even if the folder is copied or moved elsewhere on an NTFS drive.

Right-click the folder, choose “Properties,” then go to the “Security” tab. Click “Edit” to manage permissions.

6\. How to Set Custom NTFS Permissions

Click “Add” to select users or groups. Choose permissions such as Full Control, Modify, Read & Execute, List Folder Contents, Read, or Write. Apply changes, and use “Advanced” for object-level permission control and inheritance management. This is crucial in business environments where sensitive data must be tightly controlled.

7\. Remove Unnecessary User Accounts

Over time, unused accounts can accumulate. Regularly review the “Security” tab on sensitive folders and remove access for any users or groups that no longer need it.

8\. Disable Simple File Sharing for More Control (Windows Pro Editions)

Simple File Sharing is enabled by default on Windows Home editions and some Pro versions. For advanced control:

Open File Explorer, click “View,” then “Options.” Go to the “View” tab and scroll down. Uncheck “Use Sharing Wizard (Recommended).” Advanced sharing settings and NTFS permissions become available.

9\. How Can I See Who Is Accessing My Files?

To track file access, use Windows’ built-in Event Viewer.

Open “Local Security Policy” (search in Start menu). Go to “Advanced Audit Policy Configuration,” then “Object Access.” Enable “Audit File System.” Set auditing on specific folders (Security tab > Advanced > Auditing). This can help you monitor unauthorized access attempts.

10\. Keep Shared Folders Organized and Minimal

Only share folders that are necessary. Create a dedicated “Shared” folder for collaboration, rather than sharing your entire Documents or Desktop folder.

11\. Use Strong Passwords and Limit the “Everyone” Group

Avoid sharing folders with the “Everyone” group unless absolutely necessary. Set strong passwords for Windows user accounts to prevent unauthorized access.

12\. Use [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) for Extra Security and Cleanup
