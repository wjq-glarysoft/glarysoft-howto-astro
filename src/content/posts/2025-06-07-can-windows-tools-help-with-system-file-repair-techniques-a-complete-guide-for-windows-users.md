Windows computers can run into problems with system files due to software conflicts, unexpected shutdowns, or malware. Broken or missing system files often cause errors, crashes, or performance issues. The good news is that Windows includes built-in tools to repair these files, and third-party utilities like Glary Utilities can make ongoing cleanup and repair even easier. This guide walks you through practical, step-by-step techniques for identifying and fixing system file issues, suitable for all levels of Windows users.

How Do I Know if My System Files Need Repair?

Frequent system crashes, error messages about missing DLLs, slow performance, or applications not starting can all point to system file corruption. If you notice these symptoms, it’s a good idea to check and repair your system files.

What Built-In Windows Tools Can I Use?

Windows provides several tools for system file repair. Here’s how to use the most effective ones:

System File Checker (SFC)

SFC is a built-in command-line tool that scans and repairs corrupted or missing system files.

Step-by-step instructions: 1. Open the Start menu and type cmd. 2. Right-click on Command Prompt and choose Run as administrator. 3. In the Command Prompt window, type: sfc /scannow 4. Press Enter and wait. This process may take 10–20 minutes. 5. When finished, review the message. If repairs were made, restart your computer.

Example: If your computer was displaying “Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files and repaired them,” it means SFC has fixed system issues automatically.

Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool (DISM)

If SFC cannot fix all problems, DISM is the next step. It repairs the underlying Windows image that SFC relies on.

Step-by-step instructions: 1. Open Command Prompt as administrator again. 2. Type: DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth 3. Press Enter and wait. This may take 10–30 minutes. 4. When finished, restart your PC. 5. Optionally, run sfc /scannow again to ensure all issues are resolved.

Example: DISM is particularly helpful if SFC reports “Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation.”

Check Disk Utility (CHKDSK)

File system errors on your hard drive can also cause system file problems.

Step-by-step instructions: 1. Open Command Prompt as administrator. 2. Type: chkdsk C: /f /r (replace C: with your system drive letter if needed) 3. Press Enter. If prompted to schedule a scan after restart, type Y and press Enter. 4. Restart your computer. The scan and repair will run automatically before Windows loads.

System Restore: Roll back Windows to a previous point when it was working properly. Open Control Panel, search for Recovery, and follow the prompts.
