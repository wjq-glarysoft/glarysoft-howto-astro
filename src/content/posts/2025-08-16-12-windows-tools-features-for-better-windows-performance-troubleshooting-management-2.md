When Windows begins to slow down, freeze, or behave unusually, advanced users know performance troubleshooting is not about trial and error but about using the right tools and techniques. Managing performance effectively requires knowing which built-in utilities to leverage and when to rely on trusted third-party software like [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) for deeper cleanup and repair. Below are 12 essential Windows tools and features that advanced users can apply to ensure smooth system performance, with examples of how they can be used in real-world troubleshooting.

1\. Task Manager Task Manager is the frontline tool for diagnosing performance bottlenecks. It provides real-time monitoring of CPU, memory, disk, and network usage. For example, when a system is sluggish, checking the Processes tab can reveal if a specific app is consuming excessive resources. Advanced users also benefit from the Performance and Startup tabs to identify bottlenecks and disable unnecessary startup items.

2\. Resource Monitor Resource Monitor extends the power of Task Manager by offering granular insights into resource usage. It allows tracking of which processes are reading or writing intensively to the disk, which is invaluable in diagnosing I/O bottlenecks. For instance, if the CPU usage appears normal but the system is unresponsive, Resource Monitor often reveals if the hard drive is saturated by background processes.

3\. Event Viewer Event Viewer is critical for diagnosing recurring performance issues that don’t have an obvious cause. Application logs, System logs, and Kernel-Power errors often point to driver issues, improper shutdowns, or services crashing repeatedly. Advanced users can filter logs to focus only on warnings and critical errors to narrow down the troubleshooting process.

4\. Reliability Monitor Reliability Monitor provides a timeline of system stability and highlights application crashes, hardware failures, or Windows Update issues. This tool is especially useful when performance degradation is suspected to be caused by a recent change, such as a driver update. Reviewing the stability index over time helps pinpoint when performance began to decline.

5\. System File Checker (SFC) SFC is a command-line tool used to scan and repair corrupted system files. Running “sfc /scannow” in an elevated Command Prompt can resolve issues where Windows functions behave unpredictably due to damaged files. Advanced users often run this in conjunction with DISM to repair the underlying Windows image.

6\. Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool (DISM) DISM complements SFC by checking and repairing the integrity of the Windows system image. The command “DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth” is often necessary when SFC cannot fix issues alone. This step ensures that Windows has a clean baseline to repair itself, reducing performance instability caused by corrupted core files.

7\. Performance Monitor Performance Monitor allows advanced users to set up performance counters and data collector sets for long-term monitoring. For example, when diagnosing intermittent slowdowns, counters for memory pressure, page file usage, or processor queue length can reveal patterns that short-term monitoring might miss.

8\. Windows Memory Diagnostic Unstable performance is sometimes caused by faulty RAM. Windows Memory Diagnostic runs during a reboot to scan for memory errors. This is particularly useful when troubleshooting unexplained crashes or freezes that do not appear in standard logs.

9\. Disk Cleanup and Storage Sense Although Storage Sense automates cleanup, advanced users still benefit from running Disk Cleanup in administrative mode to remove system cache, old Windows installations, and update files. This frees up disk space and reduces fragmentation issues, particularly useful when managing SSDs with limited capacity.

10\. CHKDSK CHKDSK scans disk drives for file system errors and bad sectors. Running “chkdsk /f /r” on a reboot is essential when performance issues stem from read/write errors at the disk level. For instance, if applications take abnormally long to load and event logs show disk I/O warnings, CHKDSK often confirms the presence of physical or logical disk issues.

11\. Glary Utilities for Comprehensive Cleanup & Repair While Windows offers several built-in tools, Glary Utilities provides advanced users with a unified platform to handle deep clean and repair tasks more efficiently. Its Registry Repair removes broken entries that accumulate from software installations and uninstalls, its Disk Cleaner eliminates leftover files, and its Startup Manager gives full control over boot processes. Unlike manual cleanup, [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) can automate scans and repairs across multiple sections of Windows, making it ideal for maintaining peak system health without juggling multiple utilities.

12\. Windows Performance Troubleshooter (Legacy) Although hidden in recent versions, the Performance Troubleshooter can still be accessed through Control Panel or via command line. It automatically scans for common performance issues such as excessive startup items or power settings misconfigurations. Combining this with manual adjustments from Task Manager or Glary Utilities ensures that no overlooked background service drags down performance.

Effective Windows performance troubleshooting is about combining built-in diagnostic tools with comprehensive cleanup and repair solutions. By mastering these 12 features, advanced users can systematically identify, isolate, and resolve performance issues, ensuring Windows runs efficiently and reliably.
