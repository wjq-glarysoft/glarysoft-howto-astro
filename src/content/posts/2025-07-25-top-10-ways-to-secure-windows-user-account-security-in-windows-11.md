Windows 11 brings various new features and improvements, but robust user account security remains a cornerstone of privacy and safety. Whether you’re a casual user or an advanced enthusiast, safeguarding your Windows account ensures your personal data and system remain uncompromised. Here are the top 10 ways to secure Windows user accounts, complete with step-by-step guides for all skill levels.

1\. Use Strong, Unique Passwords

Step-by-step: - Open Settings (Press Windows key + I). - Select Accounts. - Choose Sign-in options. - Under Password, click Change. - Follow the prompts to set a new, complex password.

5\. Keep Windows and Software Updated
