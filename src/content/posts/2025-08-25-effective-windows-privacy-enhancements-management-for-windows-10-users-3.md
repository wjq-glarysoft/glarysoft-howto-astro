Protecting privacy on Windows 10 involves more than just installing an antivirus. Microsoft’s operating system collects data to improve user experience, but many settings can be adjusted to reduce unnecessary data sharing and improve personal security. This step-by-step guide shows how both beginners and advanced users can take control of their privacy settings, while also using tools like Glary Utilities for deeper system management.

What are the key privacy settings beginners should adjust first? For Windows 10 beginners, the first step is to review and manage privacy settings available directly in the system.

Step 1: Access the Privacy menu 1. Click the Start button. 2. Select Settings (the gear icon). 3. Choose Privacy.

Step 2: Manage general privacy options In Privacy > General, turn off the following options: - Let apps use advertising ID to make ads more relevant. - Allow websites to access your language list. - Allow Windows to track app launches to improve Start menu suggestions.

Step 3: Control app permissions In Privacy, review App Permissions categories such as Location, Camera, Microphone, and Contacts. Disable access for apps that don’t require these permissions. For example, a calculator app does not need access to your microphone or location.

Step 4: Review diagnostics and feedback Go to Privacy > Diagnostics & feedback. Select “Basic” instead of “Full” to limit the amount of data sent to Microsoft. Also, disable tailored experiences that use diagnostic data to offer tips or recommendations.

How can intermediate users improve privacy further? For those with more confidence in navigating Windows 10, some additional steps provide stronger privacy control.

Step 1: Disable background apps 1. Open Settings > Privacy > Background apps. 2. Turn off apps that don’t need to run in the background, such as Xbox Game Bar or Microsoft News. This reduces data collection and improves performance.

Step 2: Manage Cortana and search history If you don’t use Cortana, disable it. Open Settings > Cortana and turn off all permissions. To clear search history, go to Settings > Search > Permissions & History and disable “Search history on this device.”

Step 3: Configure browser privacy Microsoft Edge collects browsing data by default. Go to Settings > Privacy, search, and services in Edge, and select “Strict” tracking prevention. Also disable “Personalized ads” by visiting Microsoft’s online ad settings page.

What advanced privacy options are available for experienced users? Advanced users can take extra measures by using Group Policy, Registry tweaks, and third-party utilities.

Step 1: Using Group Policy (Windows 10 Pro and Enterprise) 1. Press Windows + R, type gpedit.msc, and press Enter. 2. Navigate to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Data Collection and Preview Builds. 3. Double-click “Allow Telemetry” and set it to “Enabled” with “0 – Security” selected. This minimizes telemetry data.

Step 2: Modifying registry values For finer control, open the Registry Editor by pressing Windows + R, typing regedit, and pressing Enter. Navigate to: HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\DataCollection Create a DWORD value named AllowTelemetry and set it to 0.

Step 3: Using Glary Utilities for privacy cleanup [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) provides a practical way to manage privacy beyond Windows settings. - Open [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) and go to the “1-Click Maintenance” tab. - Select “Privacy” and “Temporary Files Cleanup” before scanning. This clears browser histories, cookies, and cached files from multiple browsers at once. - Use the “Tracks Eraser” feature under Advanced Tools > Privacy to securely delete usage traces, such as recently opened documents and media player histories. This ensures sensitive information isn’t left behind for others to find.

How can users maintain privacy on an ongoing basis? Privacy management is not a one-time task. Regular checks and cleanups keep your system secure.

Beginners should review privacy settings once every few months to ensure no updates reset preferences. Intermediate users should monitor background apps and permissions periodically. Advanced users should combine built-in controls with tools like Glary Utilities to automate cleanups and remove traces of personal activity.

By taking a layered approach, from basic settings to advanced cleanup tools, Windows 10 users can significantly enhance privacy, reduce unnecessary data sharing, and maintain better control over their personal information.
