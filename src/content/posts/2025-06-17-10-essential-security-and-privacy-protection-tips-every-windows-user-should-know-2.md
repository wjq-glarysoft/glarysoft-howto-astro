In today’s hyper-connected world, Windows users face an evolving landscape of threats targeting both security and privacy. Even advanced users must remain vigilant to protect sensitive data and system integrity. This article outlines ten actionable tips, each rooted in real-world best practices, to help advanced Windows users reinforce their defenses and maintain privacy.

Are Your User Accounts Properly Secured?

Start by ensuring all local and Microsoft accounts use strong, unique passwords combined with two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible. Advanced users can leverage Windows Hello for biometric authentication, and manage credentials through tools like Windows Credential Manager. Regularly audit user accounts by running "net user" in Command Prompt to uncover unknown or dormant accounts that may pose risks.

How Can You Minimize Attack Surfaces in Windows?

Reduce unnecessary system services and features. Use the "Turn Windows features on or off" interface to disable components such as SMBv1, Telnet client, or legacy Internet Explorer. Uninstall bloatware and legacy apps via PowerShell commands. For example, "Get-WindowsFeature" and "Remove-WindowsFeature" help you control server roles and features on Windows Server editions.

Are Your Systems and Applications Always Up to Date?

Patch management is critical. Enable Windows Update for automatic OS and driver updates, but also regularly check for firmware and BIOS updates from your device manufacturer. Use PowerShell scripts or WSUS (Windows Server Update Services) for centralized management in multi-system environments. Don’t neglect third-party applications—tools like Glary Utilities can scan and notify you about outdated software, and even assist with batch updates for safer computing.

How Do You Strengthen Network Security?

Advanced users should configure Windows Firewall with custom inbound and outbound rules using "wf.msc". Block unneeded ports and restrict application network access. Employ VPNs with strong encryption for remote work, and use PowerShell to automate firewall configuration across multiple devices. For Wi-Fi networks, ensure WPA3 encryption is enabled and regularly rotate passphrases.

What’s the Best Way to Manage Sensitive Data and Encryption?

Encrypt critical files and drives with BitLocker or VeraCrypt. Configure BitLocker Group Policy settings for strong encryption algorithms (e.g., XTS-AES 256-bit). Use EFS (Encrypting File System) for per-file encryption in NTFS volumes. Remember to securely back up recovery keys offline. For managing and erasing sensitive data, [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) provides a File Shredder feature that securely deletes files beyond recovery.

How Can You Control Application Permissions and Data Leakage?

Review and restrict app permissions in Windows Privacy settings, especially for microphone, camera, contacts, and location. Use "App & browser control" in Windows Security to enforce stricter SmartScreen policies. Advanced users can monitor app behavior and block suspicious processes using Windows Defender Application Control or third-party application whitelisting software.

Are Your Browsing Habits Private?

Use privacy-centric browsers like Mozilla Firefox or Brave, configured with anti-tracking extensions such as uBlock Origin and HTTPS Everywhere. Regularly clear browsing history and cookies—Glary Utilities includes a Browser Cleaner tool that erases tracking cookies and cached data across multiple browsers with a single scan. Use DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) to encrypt DNS queries, and consider anonymizing extensions or VPNs for sensitive activities.

How Do You Protect Against Malware and Ransomware?

Beyond Windows Defender, advanced users should consider additional layers of protection. Configure Controlled Folder Access to guard key directories against unauthorized changes. Use PowerShell scripts to monitor real-time changes in sensitive locations, and enable attack surface reduction rules through Group Policy. Schedule Glary Utilities’ Malware Remover to scan for hidden threats, removing adware, spyware, and other malware not caught by standard antivirus programs.

What Steps Can You Take to Avoid Phishing and Social Engineering?

No matter your expertise, human factors remain a leading security risk. Use email clients with robust spam and phishing detection. Configure security awareness reminders in Outlook or via third-party plugins. For added protection, enable Office Protected View for documents from untrusted sources and use Windows Defender's anti-phishing features. Always verify URLs and sender addresses for authenticity before responding or clicking links.

How Can You Audit and Maintain Privacy Over Time?

Regular privacy audits are essential. Use Windows’ built-in Diagnostic Data Viewer to check what information is being sent to Microsoft, and adjust feedback and diagnostic levels through Group Policy. Use Glary Utilities’ privacy modules to automatically clean traces of user activity, including clipboard history, temporary files, and chat logs, ensuring no private data lingers longer than necessary.

In summary, advanced Windows security and privacy require a proactive, multi-layered approach. By combining built-in Windows tools, third-party utilities like [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com), and regular audits, you can significantly reduce risks and ensure your data and system remain secure in an ever-changing threat landscape.
