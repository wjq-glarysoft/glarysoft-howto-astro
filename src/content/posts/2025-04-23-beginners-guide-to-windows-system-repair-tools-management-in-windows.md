Windows systems can encounter a variety of issues over time, ranging from performance slowdowns to more serious errors that require repair. Fortunately, Windows offers several built-in tools designed to help you maintain and repair your system effectively. As an advanced beginner, understanding how to utilize these tools can save you time and enhance your PC’s performance.

What Are the Key Windows Repair Tools?

1\. System File Checker (SFC): - The SFC tool is a command-line utility that scans and repairs corrupted system files. If you notice your Windows behaving oddly or crashing, SFC can be a lifesaver. - To use SFC, open the Command Prompt as an administrator and type \`sfc /scannow\`. This command will check all protected system files and replace corrupted files with a cached copy located in a compressed folder at \`%WinDir%\\System32\\dllcache\`.

2\. DISM (Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool): - DISM is another powerful command-line tool that can repair a corrupted Windows image, which might be causing system issues. - Run it by opening Command Prompt as an administrator and typing \`DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth\`. This command will check for component store corruption and restore the health of the Windows image.

3\. Windows Startup Repair: - If your Windows fails to start, the Startup Repair tool is specifically designed to fix startup issues by scanning your PC for the problem and attempting to fix it.

4\. Check Disk Utility (CHKDSK): - CHKDSK checks the integrity of your hard disk and fixes logical file system errors. Run it by typing \`chkdsk /f\` in Command Prompt to fix errors, or \`chkdsk /r\` to locate bad sectors and recover readable information.

How Can Glary Utilities Enhance Your Repair Toolkit?
