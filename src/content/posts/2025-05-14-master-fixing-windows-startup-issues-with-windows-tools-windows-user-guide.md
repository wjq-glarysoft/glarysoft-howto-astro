When your Windows PC fails to start correctly, it can be frustrating and worrisome. However, with some practical steps and the right tools, many startup issues can be resolved relatively easily. This guide will walk you through best practices for fixing Windows startup issues, providing both beginner-friendly and advanced instructions.

Why Won’t Windows Start?

Understanding the root of startup issues is key to resolving them. Common causes include corrupted system files, recent hardware changes, malware, and software conflicts. Identifying the specific cause will help you choose the appropriate solution.

Section 1: Basic Troubleshooting for Beginners

How Can I Use Startup Repair?

Windows Startup Repair is an automated tool that can fix many common startup problems.

1\. Begin by restarting your computer and pressing the F8 key before the Windows logo appears. 2. Select "Repair Your Computer" from the Advanced Boot Options menu. 3. Choose your keyboard layout and log in with your administrative credentials. 4. Select "Startup Repair" from the System Recovery Options menu.

This process will attempt to fix issues automatically. If it fails, you will see a detailed report on what went wrong.

What Is Safe Mode and How Do I Use It?

Safe Mode starts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and services, useful for diagnosing and fixing problems.

1\. Restart your computer and press F8 before Windows starts. 2. Select "Safe Mode" from the list.

Once in Safe Mode, you can uninstall recent updates or drivers that might be causing the issue. To exit Safe Mode, simply restart your computer.

How Can I Run System File Checker?

Corrupted or missing system files can prevent Windows from starting. System File Checker (SFC) can find and fix such files.

This utility will repair any corrupted system files it detects, which may resolve your startup issues.

If startup problems are due to a corrupted Master Boot Record (MBR), the Bootrec command can help.

1\. Boot your computer using a Windows installation media. 2. Select "Repair your computer" > "Troubleshoot" > "Advanced options" > "Command Prompt". 3. In Command Prompt, type \`bootrec /fixmbr\` and press Enter. 4. Follow with \`bootrec /fixboot\` and \`bootrec /rebuildbcd\`.

These commands will repair the MBR and rebuild the Boot Configuration Data, which can resolve boot-related issues.
