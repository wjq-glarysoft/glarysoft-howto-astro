Windows systems are built with strong security and privacy settings, but savvy intermediate users know that the default protection isn’t always enough. Everyday threats evolve quickly, so going beyond basic antivirus and firewall settings is smart. This article explores advanced yet approachable methods to increase your Windows security and privacy, with practical steps and real-world examples.

Why Go Beyond Default Security?

Default security settings on Windows provide a baseline level of protection, but modern threats—like ransomware, phishing attacks, and invasive tracking—require a multi-layered defense. By customizing and enhancing these settings, you can reduce vulnerabilities and control how your data is accessed and shared.

How Can You Harden Local Account Security?

1\. Use Strong, Unique Passwords and Enable Two-Factor Authentication Most users have a single password for everything, but using a password manager helps generate and store complex, unique passwords for each account. For Microsoft accounts, enable two-factor authentication (2FA) via your account settings at account.microsoft.com/security for an added layer of protection.

2\. Limit Administrator Access Create a standard user account for daily tasks and reserve administrator privileges only for system changes. This minimizes the risk of malware making system-wide changes.

What Advanced Network Security Steps Should You Take?

1\. Harden Windows Firewall Rules Beyond the default firewall, open Windows Security, go to Firewall & network protection, and manage rules. Block inbound connections by default and only allow specific applications as needed. Advanced users can use the built-in Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security console (wf.msc) to customize rules by port, protocol, and program.

2\. Enable Secure DNS Switch to a privacy-focused DNS provider such as Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) or Google DNS (8.8.8.8). In Network & Internet settings, edit the network adapter properties and set the DNS servers manually. This helps prevent DNS-based attacks and can filter malicious domains.

How Do You Minimize Data Tracking and Telemetry?

1\. Configure Privacy Settings Navigate to Windows Settings > Privacy. Disable advertising ID, turn off location tracking, and restrict app permissions (like camera, microphone, and contacts). Review each category, especially under Activity History and Diagnostics & feedback. Set Diagnostic data to Basic.

2\. Block Telemetry with Advanced Tools For more control, use tools like O&O ShutUp10 or W10Privacy to disable hidden telemetry and data collection features that aren’t easily accessible via standard settings. Remember to read the documentation to avoid breaking essential Windows functions.

How Can You Encrypt Data Effectively?

1\. Use BitLocker or Device Encryption BitLocker (available in Pro and Enterprise editions) encrypts your entire drive, protecting data even if your device is lost or stolen. Enable it from Control Panel > System and Security > BitLocker Drive Encryption. Home edition users can use third-party tools like VeraCrypt for file or partition encryption.

2\. Encrypt Individual Files For sensitive documents, compress them with password protection using Windows’ built-in zip functionality or third-party tools. This adds an extra layer of security beyond full-disk encryption.

How Can Glary Utilities Enhance Security and Privacy?

[Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) is a trusted tool for Windows optimization, but it also offers valuable privacy and security features. For intermediate users, utilize these functions:

\- Tracks Eraser: Removes browser history, cookies, and recent file lists, protecting your privacy from local snooping. - File Shredder: Securely deletes files, making recovery impossible—a must for sensitive data. - Startup Manager: Lets you control which programs run at boot, reducing attack surfaces by disabling unwanted or suspicious startup items. - Registry Cleaner: Cleans invalid registry entries, which can sometimes be exploited for persistence by malware. - Software Updater: Keeps applications current, reducing vulnerabilities from outdated software.

To use these tools, open Glary Utilities, select the corresponding module (such as Privacy & Security), and follow the on-screen instructions for each task.

What About Application and Patch Management?

Regularly updating Windows via Windows Update is crucial, but third-party apps can be overlooked and become security risks. Use [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com)’ Software Updater to scan for and install updates to non-Microsoft software, closing security holes before attackers can exploit them.

Should You Use Sandboxing and Application Control?

For extra security, especially when testing new software or visiting risky websites, run them in a sandboxed environment. Tools like Windows Sandbox (available in Windows 10/11 Pro and Enterprise editions) or third-party solutions such as Sandboxie let you isolate applications from your main system, minimizing potential damage from malware or exploits.

How Do You Audit and Monitor Security Regularly?

Enable Windows Defender’s periodic scans, review the Protection history regularly in Windows Security, and set up notifications for suspicious activity. For enhanced monitoring, consider Windows’ built-in Event Viewer to audit logon attempts and system changes.

Conclusion

Staying safe on Windows requires a proactive approach. By hardening account controls, tightening network permissions, minimizing data exposure, encrypting sensitive information, and using comprehensive utilities like Glary Utilities, intermediate users can vastly improve their system’s security and privacy. Regular audits and a willingness to adapt to new threats will keep your defenses robust.
