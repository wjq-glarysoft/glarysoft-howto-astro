The command line in Windows is a powerful tool that allows you to perform a multitude of tasks efficiently. For advanced users, mastering these tools can greatly enhance productivity and system management. Here, we explore seven essential command line tips that every advanced Windows user should know.

1\. How to Use 'chkdsk' for Disk Checking and Repair

The 'chkdsk' command is invaluable for diagnosing and repairing disk errors. To use it, follow these steps: - Open Command Prompt as an administrator. - Type \`chkdsk C: /f /r\` and press Enter. - If the drive is in use, it will ask to schedule a scan. Press Y, then Enter, and restart your computer to let the scan occur during boot.

This command checks for logical errors (/f) and bad sectors (/r), ensuring your drive’s health.

2\. How to Clean Up Your System with 'cleanmgr'

While not purely a command line tool, 'cleanmgr' can be executed from it for convenience: - Type \`cleanmgr\` in Command Prompt and press Enter. - Use \`/sageset:n\` (where n is a number) to establish cleanup settings. For instance, \`cleanmgr /sageset:1\` opens a settings window. - After setting options, run \`cleanmgr /sagerun:1\` to perform cleanup with the saved settings.

3\. How to Manage Files with 'robocopy'

'robocopy' is an advanced file copy tool that supports directory mirroring and file filtering. An example use: - To copy all files in a directory, type \`robocopy C:\\Source D:\\Destination /MIR\`. - Use options like \`/S\` to copy subdirectories or \`/XD\` to exclude specific directories.

This command is perfect for creating backups or synchronizing folders.

4\. How to Monitor System Performance with 'tasklist' and 'taskkill'

Similar to Task Manager, 'tasklist' and 'taskkill' provide process management: - Type \`tasklist\` to view running processes. - To end a process, use \`taskkill /PID /F\`. Replace \`\` with the actual ID from the tasklist.

This is particularly useful when dealing with unresponsive applications.

5\. How to Configure Network Settings with 'ipconfig'

Use 'ipconfig' for networking tasks: - Type \`ipconfig /all\` to view detailed network configuration. - Use \`ipconfig /release\` and \`ipconfig /renew\` to refresh your IP address.

These commands help resolve connectivity issues by re-establishing the network connection.

6\. How to Automate Tasks with 'schtasks'

For scheduling tasks, 'schtasks' is unmatched: - Create a new task with \`schtasks /create /tn "Backup" /tr "C:\\BackupScript.bat" /sc daily /st 02:00\`. - This schedules a script to run daily at 2 AM.

Pair it with [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) to streamline system optimization tasks by automating routine checks and maintenance.

7\. How to Check System Information with 'systeminfo'

The 'systeminfo' command provides comprehensive system details: - Type \`systeminfo\` to obtain information like boot time, installed hotfixes, and more.

This is handy for diagnosing system performance issues and ensuring hardware compatibility with software updates.

By integrating these command line tools into your routine, you can enhance your Windows management capabilities significantly. For those seeking to automate and simplify these tasks further, Glary Utilities offers a complementary suite of tools to keep your system running smoothly.
