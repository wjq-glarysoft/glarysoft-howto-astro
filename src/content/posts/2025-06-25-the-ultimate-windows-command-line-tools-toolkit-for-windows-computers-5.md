For intermediate Windows users looking to elevate their system management and troubleshooting skills, mastering command line tools is invaluable. Windows provides a robust set of built-in command line utilities that can help you automate maintenance, diagnose issues, optimize performance, and perform complex system tasks with precision. This guide explores essential command line tools every Windows user should know, how to use them effectively, and where they fit within your system toolkit.

Why Use Command Line Tools on Windows?

Command line tools offer several advantages over graphical user interface (GUI) options. They are faster, scriptable for automation, often provide deeper access to system internals, and are available even when Windows Explorer or settings panels fail. When paired with efficient GUI-based utilities like Glary Utilities for regular maintenance, command line tools round out a professional’s toolkit for complete control over a Windows system.

What Are the Must-Know Windows Command Line Tools?

1\. System File Checker (sfc)

Purpose: Repairs missing or corrupted system files.

How to use: Open Command Prompt as Administrator and run: sfc /scannow

This scans integrity of system files and automatically repairs problems. Use it if you encounter crashes, unexplained errors, or after malware removal.

2\. Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM)

Purpose: Fixes deeper Windows image issues that SFC cannot.

How to use: Run Command Prompt as Administrator: DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth

This command repairs the underlying Windows image, particularly useful when SFC returns errors it cannot fix.

3\. Check Disk Utility (chkdsk)

Purpose: Scans and repairs file system errors and bad sectors on disk drives.

How to use: chkdsk C: /f /r

This scans drive C: for errors (/f flag) and attempts to recover bad sectors (/r flag). Schedule this at reboot if prompted.

4\. Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC)

Purpose: Powerful system information and management tool.

Examples: To list installed software: wmic product get name,version

To check battery health (on laptops): wmic path Win32\_Battery get EstimatedChargeRemaining

5\. Tasklist and Taskkill

Purpose: Manage running processes from the command line.

Examples: View running tasks: tasklist

End a stuck process: taskkill /IM notepad.exe /F

6\. Netstat

Purpose: Network diagnostics—shows active connections and listening ports.

Command: netstat -ano

Displays all connections, the associated process ID, and listening ports. Useful for identifying suspicious activity or troubleshooting network issues.

7\. Ipconfig and Ping

Purpose: Network configuration and troubleshooting.

Check your IP address: ipconfig

Test network connectivity: ping google.com

8\. Powercfg

Purpose: Advanced power management and battery diagnostics.

Generate a battery report: powercfg /batteryreport

The report is saved as HTML and can be opened in your browser for in-depth battery analysis.

How Can You Automate System Maintenance Tasks?

Intermediate users can combine these tools in batch files (.bat) to automate routine maintenance. For example, create a batch script that runs sfc, DISM, and chkdsk for monthly system health checks. Schedule it using Task Scheduler for complete hands-free operation.

Where Does [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) Fit In?

While command line tools are excellent for targeted troubleshooting and automation, Glary Utilities provides a comprehensive, user-friendly suite for ongoing PC optimization. It features:

\- One-click cleanup for junk files and invalid registry entries - Startup manager to control boot programs - Disk repair and defrag tools - Privacy protection and file shredding - Scheduled automatic maintenance

You can run [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) after using command line tools to ensure residual temporary files, redundant registry entries, and privacy traces are cleaned up. This dual approach—command line for deep troubleshooting and [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) for regular optimization—keeps your Windows system running smoothly and efficiently.

What Are Some Practical Command Line Tool Use Cases?

\- After a Windows update fails, use sfc and DISM in sequence to repair potential file corruption. - If a drive is behaving erratically, run chkdsk to check for and repair file system errors. - For persistent network issues, use ipconfig to flush DNS and netstat to identify open or suspicious ports. - Automate daily process monitoring by scripting tasklist output to a log file for review.

Conclusion

Command line tools in Windows are powerful assets for intermediate users who want more control and insight into their systems. By mastering essential tools like sfc, DISM, chkdsk, and combining them with all-in-one solutions such as Glary Utilities, you can maintain, troubleshoot, and optimize any Windows PC like a pro. Experiment with these tools, incorporate automation where possible, and you’ll unlock the full potential of your Windows environment.
