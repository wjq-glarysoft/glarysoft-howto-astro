Windows system monitoring and analysis are critical tasks for ensuring the optimal performance and security of your computer. Advanced users and IT professionals often seek deep insights into their system's operations to diagnose issues, optimize performance, and enhance security. This article provides practical, actionable advice for advanced system monitoring and analysis techniques using built-in Windows tools and third-party utilities like Glary Utilities.

1\. Utilizing Windows Performance Monitor

Windows Performance Monitor is a powerful tool that allows users to capture a variety of system metrics in real-time. To start:

\- Open Performance Monitor by typing "perfmon" in the Run dialog (Windows Key + R). - Navigate to Data Collector Sets and click on "User Defined". - Create a new Data Collector Set to monitor specific counters such as CPU usage, memory, disk I/O, and network performance. - Schedule the Data Collector Set to run at specific intervals to gather data for analysis.

By analyzing the collected data, you can identify patterns and potential bottlenecks affecting system performance.

2\. Event Viewer for Tracking System Events

The Windows Event Viewer logs significant system events, which can be invaluable for diagnosing errors and understanding system behavior:

\- Open Event Viewer by typing "eventvwr" in the Run dialog. - Review logs such as the System, Application, and Security logs. - Use filtering to focus on critical errors and warnings that require immediate attention.

Regularly reviewing these logs helps in preemptively identifying issues before they escalate.

3\. Command Line Tools for Detailed Analysis

Advanced users can leverage command-line tools for in-depth system analysis:

\- Use the "tasklist" and "taskkill" commands to view and manage running processes. - "ipconfig" and "netstat" provide insights into network configuration and active connections, crucial for network troubleshooting. - "sfc /scannow" and "DISM" commands help repair system file corruption and restore system health.

4\. PowerShell for Custom Monitoring Scripts

PowerShell offers the flexibility to create custom scripts for monitoring tasks:

\- Use PowerShell scripts to automate data collection on performance counters, event logs, and service statuses. - Combine the output with CSV or JSON format for easier reporting and analysis.

For example, a simple script can be created to check and log the status of critical services every hour.

5\. Glary Utilities for Comprehensive System Monitoring

Glary Utilities is an all-in-one utility that provides robust system monitoring features:

\- Use the "System Information" module to get a detailed overview of your hardware and software configuration. - The "Process Manager" feature offers a real-time view of running processes, similar to Task Manager, but with enhanced capabilities like batch process termination. - Glary Utilities' "Disk Space Analyzer" helps visualize space usage to identify files or folders that can be cleaned to improve performance.

6\. Analyzing Resource Usage with Resource Monitor

Resource Monitor provides a graphical overview of system resource usage:

\- Access Resource Monitor by typing "resmon" in the Run dialog. - Monitor CPU, memory, disk, and network usage with real-time graphs and detailed statistics. - Identify high-resource-consuming processes and analyze their impact on system performance.

By understanding resource usage patterns, you can make informed decisions on performance optimization.

Incorporating these advanced monitoring techniques into your routine system maintenance practices can significantly enhance your ability to manage and optimize your Windows system's performance. Regular monitoring not only helps in maintaining system health but also in effectively troubleshooting and resolving issues as they arise.
