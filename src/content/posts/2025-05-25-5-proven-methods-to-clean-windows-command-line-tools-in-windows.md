Windows comes packed with powerful command line tools that are essential for troubleshooting, system maintenance, and automation. Over time, however, these tools and their associated files—like temporary data, logs, or outdated configurations—may accumulate clutter, affecting both performance and usability. Regularly cleaning and maintaining Windows command line tools is a best practice not just for advanced users but for beginners as well. Here are five proven methods, along with step-by-step instructions and practical examples, to keep your system’s command line tools clean and efficient.
