The Windows Command Line, commonly accessed via Command Prompt, offers a plethora of tools for maintaining and optimizing your Windows system. While more visual tools exist, understanding how to use command line utilities can give you powerful control over your system. This article will guide you through some practical examples of using command line tools for system maintenance.

Opening Command Prompt

To begin, you need to open Command Prompt: 1. Press the Windows key, type "cmd," and press Enter. Alternatively, right-click the Start button and select "Command Prompt (Admin)" to access administrative privileges necessary for many commands.

Checking Disk Health with CHKDSK

The Check Disk utility, CHKDSK, scans your drive for errors and attempts to fix them: 1. In Command Prompt, type \`chkdsk C: /f\` and press Enter. Replace "C:" with the letter of the drive you wish to check. 2. If prompted, type "Y" to schedule a scan on the next system restart. Restart your computer to let CHKDSK perform the check.

Cleaning Up Your Disk with Cleanmgr

While Cleanmgr is a graphical tool, it can also be operated via the command line for automated cleanups: 1. Type \`cleanmgr /sageset:n\` where "n" is a number 0-65535. This opens a settings window allowing you to select files to delete. 2. After selecting the desired options, click OK. Next, type \`cleanmgr /sagerun:n\` to execute the cleanup using your saved settings.

Managing System Files with SFC

The System File Checker tool scans and repairs corrupted system files: 1. Enter \`sfc /scannow\` in Command Prompt. This process may take some time as it scans and repairs files.

Using DISM for System Image Repairs

The Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool can repair the system image: 1. Run \`DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth\` to find and repair any issues in the system image.

Task Automation with Batch Files

Automating regular maintenance tasks can save time: 1. Open Notepad and write your series of commands, such as: \`\`\` chkdsk C: /f sfc /scannow DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth \`\`\` 2. Save the file with a .bat extension, for example, "maintenance.bat". 3. To execute, right-click the batch file and select "Run as administrator".
