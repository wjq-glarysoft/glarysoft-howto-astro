Windows startup issues can be a frustrating experience, even for advanced users. However, with the right approach and tools, you can efficiently troubleshoot and resolve these issues. This article will guide you through both basic and advanced techniques to fix Windows startup problems, emphasizing the importance of system cleanup and repair.

What Are the Basic Checks for Startup Issues?

Check Power Supply and Peripherals: Ensure that your power supply is functioning correctly. Unplug unnecessary peripherals which may cause conflicts during startup.

Verify BIOS/UEFI Settings: Enter the BIOS/UEFI settings to check if the boot order is set correctly. Ensure your primary hard drive is the first boot device.

Safe Mode Boot: Attempt to boot into Safe Mode by pressing F8 during startup. Safe Mode loads the OS with minimal drivers, which can help diagnose if a third-party application or driver is causing the issue.

How Can You Use Windows Built-in Tools?

Startup Repair: Access the Recovery Environment by booting from a Windows installation media. Choose "Repair your computer," then navigate to "Troubleshoot" > "Advanced Options" > "Startup Repair."

Event Viewer: Check the Event Viewer for any critical errors or warnings that occur during startup. Filter logs for the latest boot sequence to identify potential issues.

System File Checker (SFC) and DISM: Open Command Prompt as an administrator and run "sfc /scannow" to repair corrupted system files. Use "DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth" to fix the Windows image if SFC finds errors it cannot repair.

What Advanced Techniques Can Be Utilized?

Analyze Boot Logs: Enable boot logging in the Advanced Boot Options menu. Review the "ntbtlog.txt" file located in C:\\Windows for detailed information about drivers and services loaded during startup.

Manage Startup Programs: Use Task Manager or a third-party tool to disable unnecessary startup programs that may be slowing down or hindering the boot process.

Registry Edits: Access the Registry Editor (regedit) to manually check for incorrect or missing startup entries. This technique requires caution, as incorrect edits can cause system instability.

Driver Rollback and Updates: Use Device Manager to rollback or update drivers that may have caused startup issues after recent updates.
