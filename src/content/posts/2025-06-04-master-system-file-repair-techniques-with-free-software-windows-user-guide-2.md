Are you noticing strange errors, slow performance, or programs crashing unexpectedly on your Windows computer? Many times, these issues are caused by damaged or missing system files. The good news is that you can repair these files yourself—often without needing expensive tools or professional help. This guide will walk you through simple, step-by-step methods to repair your system files using free software, even if you’re completely new to Windows maintenance.

What are system files and why do they matter?

System files are the essential building blocks of Windows. They help your computer boot, run programs, and carry out daily tasks. If these files become corrupted or go missing—perhaps due to malware, improper shutdowns, or failed updates—you may experience freezes, error messages, or boot problems.

How can I check for system file problems?

Before repairing, let’s check if your system files are actually damaged.

1\. Use the Built-in System File Checker (SFC)

Windows comes with a handy built-in tool called System File Checker, or SFC for short. Here’s how to use it:

\- Type “cmd” in the Windows search bar. - Right-click “Command Prompt” and select “Run as administrator.” - In the Command Prompt window, type: sfc /scannow

\- Press Enter.

The tool will begin scanning for corrupted or missing system files and will attempt to fix them. This process can take some time, so be patient. When it’s done, you’ll see a message indicating whether problems were found and fixed.

What if SFC can’t solve the problem?

Sometimes, SFC may say it found issues but couldn’t fix them all. In these cases, try a more advanced tool called Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool (DISM):

1\. Open Command Prompt as administrator (repeat the steps above). 2. Type the following command and press Enter:

DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth

DISM will check Windows’ deeper system images and attempt to repair them. This tool can take 10-30 minutes to complete. Once done, run SFC again to make sure all repairs are finished.

How can [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) help with system repair?

While SFC and DISM are great, they can miss issues related to system clutter, broken shortcuts, or leftover files from old programs. Here’s where Glary Utilities—a trusted, free Windows optimization tool—comes in handy.

Glary Utilities offers a user-friendly way to clean up and repair your Windows system beyond basic file checks.

How to use Glary Utilities for cleanup and repair:

1\. Download and install Glary Utilities from the official website. 2. Open [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com). On the main screen, click “1-Click Maintenance.” 3. Make sure these options are checked: Registry Cleaner, Shortcuts Fixer, Temporary Files Cleaner, and Disk Repair. 4. Click “Scan for Issues.” 5. Once the scan is complete, review the results and click “Repair Problems.”

This process will clean your registry, remove invalid shortcuts, delete junk files, and find common disk errors that can slow down your system. Many Windows problems caused by clutter or broken registry entries can be resolved this way.

What if Windows won’t start at all?

If you can’t even log into Windows, you can try repairing system files from Windows Recovery Environment:

1\. Turn on your PC and as Windows starts, hold down the power button to force shutdown. Repeat this process two or three times until you see “Preparing Automatic Repair.” 2. Click “Advanced options” and choose “Command Prompt.” 3. Use the same SFC and DISM commands as above to attempt repairs.

How to prevent system file issues in the future

\- Always shut down your computer properly—avoid force powering off unless necessary. - Keep Windows and other software up to date. - Run [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) regularly to keep your system clean and healthy. - Install a good antivirus to prevent malware that can corrupt system files.

Final thoughts

System file corruption is a common cause of Windows errors, but with free tools like Windows’ SFC and DISM, along with Glary Utilities for deeper cleanup, you can resolve most issues yourself—even as a beginner. Make a habit of regular maintenance, and your computer will stay faster and more reliable for years to come.
