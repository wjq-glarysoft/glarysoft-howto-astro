Windows system information tools are essential utilities for diagnosing, monitoring, and troubleshooting a PC. While these tools provide important insights about your system’s hardware and software, they can also expose sensitive information if not properly managed. Securing access to these tools is vital—especially in shared or work environments. This article will guide you through practical steps to secure system information tools in Windows, saving you time and preventing potential data leaks or unauthorized changes. Whether you’re a beginner or an advanced user, these tips and examples will help keep your system information safe.

What Are Windows System Information Tools?

Windows includes several built-in tools to display and troubleshoot system information. The most commonly used ones are:

\- System Information (msinfo32) - Task Manager - Resource Monitor - System Configuration (msconfig) - Command Prompt and PowerShell

These tools reveal details like hardware specs, driver versions, running processes, network activity, and more. While they are powerful for maintenance and optimization, they also represent a security risk if left unprotected.

Why Secure These Tools?

Unauthorized users or malware can misuse system information tools to gather data about your machine, discover vulnerabilities, or make harmful changes. For example, someone with access to Task Manager could terminate essential processes or view sensitive running applications. Therefore, securing these tools should be a part of your routine PC maintenance.

For Beginners: Quick Security Tips

1\. Use a Standard User Account for Daily Tasks

Most system information tools require administrative privileges to make changes. By using a standard (non-admin) account for daily activities, you limit unauthorized access:

\- Open Settings - Go to Accounts > Family & other users - Create a new user account and assign it as a Standard User

2\. Password-Protect User Accounts

Ensure all accounts on your PC are protected by strong, unique passwords. This prevents others from logging in and accessing system tools.

3\. Lock Your PC When Away

Always lock your PC (Windows key + L) when stepping away. This prevents someone from accessing system information tools while you’re not present.

4\. Clean Up with Glary Utilities

Use [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) to regularly clean user traces, temporary files, and system logs that could reveal sensitive information. Its "Tracks Eraser" and "Privacy Cleaner" features remove records of recently used files and activities, reducing the risk of information exposure.

For Advanced Users: Enhancing Security and Saving Time

1\. Restrict Access Using Local Group Policy Editor

Windows Pro and Enterprise editions allow you to restrict access to specific tools:

\- Press Windows key + R, type gpedit.msc, then press Enter. - Navigate to User Configuration > Administrative Templates > System - Find policies like "Don't run specified Windows applications" or "Prevent access to the command prompt" - Add the executable names you want to restrict (e.g., msinfo32.exe, taskmgr.exe)

This method lets you quickly disable access for all standard users, saving time on manual configuration.

2\. Audit Tool Usage with Event Viewer

Enable auditing to log when system tools are accessed:

\- Open Local Security Policy (secpol.msc) - Go to Local Policies > Audit Policy - Enable "Audit process tracking" and review logs in Event Viewer for suspicious usage

This helps advanced users monitor attempts to access sensitive tools and respond promptly.

3\. Use Third-Party Security Suites for Extra Protection

Along with Windows Defender, consider security suites that offer application control features. These can block unauthorized applications—including system tools—from running without explicit permission.

4\. Automate Maintenance with Glary Utilities

[Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) streamlines security and optimization tasks. Use its "Startup Manager" to monitor and disable unwanted programs, and its "Security Process Explorer" to review running processes and flag suspicious activity. Scheduling automatic cleanups ensures your system is consistently protected without manual intervention.

Real-World Example: Securing a Shared Family PC

Suppose you manage a family computer used by adults and children. To prevent accidental changes:

\- Set up standard accounts for each family member. - Restrict access to msconfig and Task Manager via Group Policy for non-admin users. - Schedule weekly cleanups with [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) to clear sensitive history and logs.

This approach saves time by automating security and keeps the system running smoothly, with minimal manual oversight.

Conclusion

Securing Windows system information tools is a crucial step in protecting your PC from misuse and information leaks. For beginners, simple measures like using standard accounts, strong passwords, and routine cleaning with Glary Utilities can make a significant difference. Advanced users can leverage Group Policy, auditing, and automated maintenance for a more robust solution. By putting these tips into practice, you’ll save time, reduce risks, and maintain tighter control over your Windows environment.
