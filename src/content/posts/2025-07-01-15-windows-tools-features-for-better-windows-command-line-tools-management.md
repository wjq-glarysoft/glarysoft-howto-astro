Getting started with Windows command line tools might seem intimidating, but they offer powerful ways to manage your PC more efficiently. If you’re a beginner, mastering a few time-saving features will help you boost productivity, maintain your system, and tackle common tasks with ease. Below, you’ll find 15 practical Windows tools features and tips for managing command line utilities, each explained with actionable advice and real-world examples.

Why Use Command Line Tools?

Command line tools give you direct access to Windows functions, sometimes faster and with more options than graphical interfaces. They’re perfect for automating tasks, troubleshooting, and system maintenance. Even if you’re new to them, small steps can make a big difference.

1\. Pin Command Prompt or PowerShell to the Taskbar

To save time, right-click Command Prompt or PowerShell in the Start menu and select “Pin to taskbar.” This way, you can launch your favorite tool with a single click.

2\. Use the Windows Terminal for Multiple Shells

Windows Terminal combines Command Prompt, PowerShell, and more in one window with tabs. Search for “Windows Terminal” in the Start menu, and pin it for quick access.

3\. Access Command Line Tools as an Administrator

Right-click Command Prompt or PowerShell and select “Run as administrator.” This is essential for system tasks like disk checks, but don’t use it for everyday commands unless necessary.

4\. Use Auto-Completion and Command History

Press the up or down arrow keys to cycle through previous commands. Use the Tab key while typing a file or folder name to auto-complete, saving time and reducing errors.

5\. Create and Use Batch Files for Routine Tasks

Batch files (.bat) automate commands. For example, create a file that runs “ipconfig /all” and “chkdsk” together. Save your batch file, then double-click it when needed.

6\. Quick System Cleanup with Command Line and Glary Utilities

For fast cleanup, use “cleanmgr” in Command Prompt to open Disk Cleanup. For a much deeper and automated cleanup, use [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com): launch it, select 1-Click Maintenance, and let it scan and clean up unnecessary files and registry issues in one go.

7\. Use the System File Checker (sfc)

If Windows feels sluggish or unstable, type “sfc /scannow” in Command Prompt (as administrator) to scan and repair system files. This process may take some time but can fix many common issues.

8\. Check Disk Health with chkdsk

Run “chkdsk /f” in Command Prompt to scan your hard drive for errors. You may need to restart your computer, but it’s a great way to preempt storage problems.

9\. Manage Network Settings Quickly

View connection information with “ipconfig /all” or refresh your IP with “ipconfig /release” followed by “ipconfig /renew.” These commands help fix network issues in seconds.

10\. List or Kill Running Tasks

Type “tasklist” to see all running processes and “taskkill /IM processname.exe” to stop a specific one. This is especially handy if a program is not responding.

11\. Find Large Files With the Command Line

Use “dir /s /b | sort” in a folder to list all files. Pair with “findstr” to show files over a certain size. For automated large file cleanup, [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) offers a “Disk Space Analyzer” module that visually identifies and helps you remove unnecessary big files.

12\. Schedule Tasks Automatically

Use “schtasks” to schedule backups or maintenance. For example, “schtasks /create /tn 'MonthlyBackup' /tr backup.bat /sc monthly” sets up a monthly backup. If scheduling feels advanced, Glary Utilities’ “Schedule Tasks” feature in its interface can simplify routine maintenance without command line knowledge.

13\. Use Windows Help for Commands

Unsure about a command? Type “command /?” (e.g., “ipconfig /?”) to see usage options and switches. This saves time searching online and helps you learn as you go.

14\. Redirect Output to a Text File

Add “> filename.txt” to a command to save its output. For example, “ipconfig /all > mynetworkinfo.txt” creates a text file with your network details, making troubleshooting or sharing easier.

15\. Combine Command Line and System Utility Tools

Many tasks can be done quicker by mixing command line use with system tools. For example, use the command line to open Windows built-in tools: “eventvwr” for Event Viewer, “perfmon” for Performance Monitor, or “msinfo32” for System Information. Use graphical tools like Glary Utilities alongside for in-depth cleaning, optimizing, and managing your PC with a beginner-friendly interface.

How Can Glary Utilities Help Beginners Manage System Tools?

While command line tools are powerful, Glary Utilities wraps many maintenance tasks—cleaning, repair, optimizing, and scheduling—into a single, easy interface. Beginners can use its 1-Click Maintenance for quick cleanup, Registry Repair to fix errors, Disk Space Analyzer for finding large files, and Startup Manager to control which programs run at startup. This complements and sometimes even replaces manual command line work, saving time and reducing errors.

Final Thoughts

You don’t need to be a command line expert to benefit from these tips. Start with the basics—pinning shortcuts, using command history, and running simple diagnostics. As you grow more confident, explore batch files, task scheduling, and advanced system commands. Pairing these tools with Glary Utilities provides a powerful, user-friendly approach to maintaining and optimizing your Windows PC. With a little practice, you’ll be managing your system faster and more efficiently than ever.
