Windows startup problems can be frustrating and disruptive, preventing you from accessing your files, applications, or even the desktop itself. Whether your PC is stuck on a black screen, endlessly rebooting, or just taking forever to start, there are practical steps you can take to clean up and repair these issues. This guide covers a range of troubleshooting strategies, from simple solutions for beginners to advanced fixes for experienced users, focusing on effective cleanup and repair techniques.

Why Do Windows Startup Issues Occur?

Startup issues can arise due to several reasons: - Corrupted or missing system files - Faulty hardware drivers - Recent software or Windows updates - Malware or unwanted programs - Excessive startup programs - Disk errors or failing hard drives

Proper cleanup and repair can resolve most startup problems and help prevent future ones.

For Beginners: Simple Steps to Clean and Fix Startup Problems

Step 1: Try Safe Mode

Safe Mode starts Windows with minimal drivers and settings, making it easier to troubleshoot.

1\. Restart your computer. 2. As soon as Windows starts loading, repeatedly press F8 (for Windows 7) or hold Shift and click Restart (for Windows 10/11). 3. Select "Safe Mode" or "Safe Mode with Networking". 4. If your PC boots successfully, the problem may be with a third-party app or driver.

Step 2: Use Windows Startup Repair

Startup Repair is a built-in Windows tool that can fix certain boot problems.

1\. Insert your Windows installation media or recovery drive. 2. Boot from the media and select "Repair your computer". 3. Go to Troubleshoot > Advanced Options > Startup Repair. 4. Follow the prompts to let Windows diagnose and fix startup issues automatically.

Step 3: Disable Unnecessary Startup Programs

Too many startup programs can slow or stall Windows boot.

1\. Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager. 2. Go to the "Startup" tab. 3. Right-click unnecessary programs and select "Disable". 4. Restart your computer to see if startup speed improves.

Step 4: Use Glary Utilities for One-Click Cleanup

[Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) is a comprehensive tool that simplifies cleaning and repairing Windows issues, making it ideal for beginners.

Glary Utilities can quickly clean junk files, fix registry errors, and optimize startup items, increasing the chances of a smooth boot.

For Advanced Users: In-Depth Troubleshooting and Repair

Step 1: Check System Files with SFC and DISM

Corrupted system files may cause startup problems.

1\. Boot into Windows or Safe Mode. 2. Open Command Prompt as administrator. 3. Type: sfc /scannow and press Enter. 4. Wait for the system file check to complete. 5. If errors are found and not fixed, use: - DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth

Step 2: Investigate the Event Viewer

The Event Viewer logs detailed startup errors.

1\. Press Windows + X and choose Event Viewer. 2. Expand "Windows Logs" and click "System". 3. Look for events marked Error or Warning around the last failed startup. 4. Note the error codes or messages for further research or troubleshooting.

Step 3: Repair the Boot Configuration

Boot Configuration Data (BCD) errors can prevent Windows from starting.

1\. Boot from installation media or recovery drive. 2. Go to Troubleshoot > Command Prompt. 3. Run these commands one by one: - bootrec /fixmbr - bootrec /fixboot - bootrec /scanos - bootrec /rebuildbcd

Step 4: Clean Up Malware and Unwanted Software

Malware often causes startup delays and instability.

1\. Boot into Safe Mode with Networking. 2. Use Glary Utilities' Malware Remover or a reputable antivirus to scan your system. 3. Remove detected threats. 4. Use the "Tracks Eraser" in Glary Utilities to clean up remnants and improve privacy.

Next, run [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) to clean registry and junk files left by the update. If problems persist, run SFC and DISM commands to repair corrupted system files. These steps often restore normal startup speed and reliability.
