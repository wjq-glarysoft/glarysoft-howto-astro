Maintaining optimal network performance is crucial for any Windows user, whether you're a home user wanting smooth streaming, a gamer seeking low latency, or an IT professional managing a business network. Below, you'll find 15 proven methods to tune and maintain your Windows network performance. This guide covers actionable steps, real-world examples, and highlights how [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) can streamline the process. Sections are clearly labeled for beginners and advanced users, ensuring that everyone can benefit from these tips.

Why is Network Performance Tuning Important?

A sluggish or unstable network can cause slow downloads, laggy video calls, and frustrating interruptions. Tuning your network ensures you consistently get the best speeds and reliability from your Windows PC—maximizing productivity and minimizing downtime.

Beginner Level: Simple Steps to Boost Network Performance

1\. Keep Windows and Drivers Updated

Windows Updates often include networking improvements and security fixes. Similarly, updating your network adapter drivers can resolve compatibility issues and improve throughput.

How to: - Go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update, and check for updates. - For drivers: Right-click Start > Device Manager > Network adapters > Right-click your adapter > Update driver.

2\. Optimize Startup Programs

Too many programs running at startup can hog bandwidth for background updates or syncs.

[Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) Solution: Use the Startup Manager to disable unnecessary programs from launching at startup, ensuring more bandwidth for essential tasks.

3\. Use Wired Connections When Possible

Wired (Ethernet) connections are generally more stable and faster than Wi-Fi. If possible, connect your PC directly to your router.

Real-World Example: Gamers often switch to Ethernet to reduce latency and avoid Wi-Fi interference during online play.

4\. Disable Unnecessary Background Apps

Background apps (like cloud sync tools or messaging clients) can silently consume bandwidth.

How to: - Go to Settings > Privacy > Background apps, and toggle off apps you don’t need running.

5\. Run Windows Network Troubleshooter

Let Windows automatically diagnose and fix common network issues.

How to: - Go to Settings > Network & Internet > Status > Network troubleshooter.

Intermediate Level: Deeper Optimization Techniques

6\. Tweak Windows Network Settings for Performance

Windows offers settings that can impact network speed, such as Large Send Offload (LSO) and Receive Side Scaling (RSS).

How to: - Device Manager > Network adapters > Right-click adapter > Properties > Advanced tab. - Adjust settings like "Large Send Offload" or "Interrupt Moderation". Test performance after each change.

7\. Clear DNS Cache

A cluttered DNS cache may cause slow web page loading.

Glary Utilities Solution: The 1-Click Maintenance tool includes a network cache cleanup, making this task effortless.

Manual Method: Open Command Prompt as Administrator, then enter: ipconfig /flushdns

8\. Change DNS Servers

Switching to a faster DNS like Google (8.8.8.8) or Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) can improve website load times.

How to: - Settings > Network & Internet > Change adapter options > Right-click your connection > Properties > Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) > Properties. - Set Preferred DNS server to 8.8.8.8 and Alternate to 8.8.4.4.

9\. Use Windows Quality of Service (QoS) Policies

QoS lets you prioritize bandwidth for critical applications, such as video calls or VoIP.

How to: - For Pro or Enterprise editions, use the Group Policy Editor: gpedit.msc > Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Policy-based QoS.

10\. Update Router Firmware and Reboot Regularly

An outdated or overworked router can bottleneck your connection. - Visit your router manufacturer’s website for firmware updates, and reboot your router at least weekly.

Advanced Level: Expert Tweaks for Power Users

11\. Adjust TCP/IP Stack Parameters

Tweaking TCP parameters like TCP Window Auto-Tuning and Receive Window Size can boost transfer speeds.

How to: - Open Command Prompt as Administrator. - To view status: netsh interface tcp show global - To enable auto-tuning: netsh interface tcp set global autotuninglevel=normal

12\. Enable Jumbo Frames (for Compatible Networks)

Jumbo Frames allow larger packets, reducing CPU load and improving throughput—especially on gigabit networks.

How to: - Device Manager > Network adapter > Properties > Advanced > Jumbo Frame. Enable and set to 9000 bytes if supported.

13\. Disable Windows Auto-Tuning (in Specific Cases)

If you're experiencing issues with certain network equipment, disabling TCP Auto-Tuning may help.

How to: - Command Prompt as Administrator: netsh interface tcp set global autotuninglevel=disabled

Test performance both ways, and revert if disabling worsens speed.

14\. Analyze Network Traffic with Resource Monitor

Track which processes and services are using your network in real time.

How to: - Search for Resource Monitor, go to the Network tab, and observe bandwidth usage. - Identify and stop bandwidth-hogging processes.

15\. Use Comprehensive Maintenance Tools like Glary Utilities

For ongoing optimization, Glary Utilities provides automated cleanup, privacy protection, and repair features, including network optimization tools. - Schedule regular maintenance with Glary Utilities’ 1-Click Maintenance to clean up network-related junk, manage startup items, and fix registry issues that could affect network performance.
