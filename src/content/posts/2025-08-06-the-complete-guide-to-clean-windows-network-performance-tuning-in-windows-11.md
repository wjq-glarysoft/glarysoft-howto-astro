This guide provides professional, actionable techniques for both beginners and advanced users, including how Glary Utilities can play a key role in ensuring clean and smooth network operation.

Why Should You Tune Your Windows 11 Network Performance?

A sluggish or unstable network can lead to slow downloads, laggy video calls, and frustrating gaming sessions. Over time, network configurations, software clutter, and outdated drivers can hinder your connection. Regular optimization not only fixes issues but also prevents new problems from arising.

Section 1: Basic Network Performance Improvements (Beginner)

What Are the Easiest Ways to Improve My Windows 11 Network Speed?

1\. Restart Your Router and Computer The simplest fix for many network issues is a full power cycle. Unplug your router for 30 seconds and restart your PC to clear temporary glitches.

2\. Update Windows 11 and Network Drivers Keeping Windows and network drivers updated can resolve compatibility and security issues. - Go to Settings > Windows Update > Check for updates. - For driver updates: Right-click the Start button, select Device Manager, expand Network adapters, right-click your adapter, and choose Update driver.

3\. Use Ethernet When Possible Wired connections generally provide more stable and faster internet than Wi-Fi. If feasible, connect your PC directly to your router.

Section 2: Intermediate Tuning for Everyday Users

How Can I Further Optimize My Network in Windows 11?

1\. Disable Bandwidth-Hogging Apps Applications like cloud sync tools or torrent clients can consume significant bandwidth in the background. - Open Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc), go to the Processes tab, sort by Network, and close unwanted apps.

2\. Set Network Profile to Private A Private network profile can improve device discovery and speed up local file sharing. - Settings > Network & Internet > Wi-Fi > Manage known networks > Select your network > Set as Private.

3\. Optimize DNS Settings Changing your DNS server to a faster, public option can sometimes reduce latency: - Go to Settings > Network & Internet > Wi-Fi (or Ethernet) > Hardware properties > Edit DNS server assignment. - Use Google (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4) or Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) DNS servers.

4\. Clean Network Junk with Glary Utilities Temporary files and obsolete registry entries can impact network performance. Glary Utilities can clean these up: - Use the 1-Click Maintenance feature in Glary Utilities. - Ensure ‘Temporary Files Cleaner’ and ‘Registry Cleaner’ are checked before running.

Section 3: Advanced Network Performance Tuning (Advanced Users)

How Can Power Users Maximize Windows 11 Network Performance?

1\. Fine-Tune TCP/IP Stack Open Command Prompt as Administrator and run: - netsh int tcp set global autotuninglevel=normal - netsh int tcp set global rss=enabled

2\. Adjust QoS Packet Scheduler By default, Windows can reserve up to 20% of your bandwidth for system processes. You can adjust this via Group Policy: - Press Win+R, type gpedit.msc, and hit Enter. - Navigate to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Network > QoS Packet Scheduler > Limit reservable bandwidth. - Set to Enabled and lower the bandwidth limit to 0%.

3\. Check for Network Adapter Advanced Properties - In Device Manager, right-click your network adapter and choose Properties. - Under the Advanced tab, adjust settings like Jumbo Frame, Interrupt Moderation, and Speed & Duplex according to your hardware and network.
