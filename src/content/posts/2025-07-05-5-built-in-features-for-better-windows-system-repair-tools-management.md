Windows operating systems are equipped with several built-in repair and maintenance tools designed to keep your PC running smoothly. Whether you’re dealing with minor glitches or significant issues, mastering these tools can help you maintain system integrity and reduce downtime. Here’s a look at five essential Windows features for system repair, with practical advice and examples for users at every level. Additionally, learn how [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) can complement these built-in features for optimal results.

What is System File Checker (SFC) and How Can You Use It?

System File Checker (SFC) is a command-line tool that scans and repairs corrupted system files. Corrupted files can cause crashes, malfunctioning features, or sluggish performance. SFC is especially valuable when you experience unexplained errors or system instability.

To run SFC: 1. Search for “Command Prompt” in the Start menu. 2. Right-click and select “Run as administrator.” 3. Type sfc /scannow and press Enter.

The scan will start automatically, repairing any corrupted system files it finds. For advanced users, running SFC in Safe Mode can increase its effectiveness, especially if issues persist during normal operations.

How Does DISM Help with Deeper System Repairs?

Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool (DISM) works alongside SFC but goes a step further by repairing the system image itself. If SFC can’t fix a problem, DISM is often the next step.

To use DISM: 1. Open Command Prompt as administrator. 2. Enter the command: DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth

DISM will check for deeper corruption in Windows components and replace damaged files using Windows Update. This is particularly useful for advanced troubleshooting after failed Windows updates or persistent SFC errors.

What Can System Restore Do for Repair and Recovery?

System Restore allows you to revert your computer’s state to a previous point in time, undoing recent changes that may have caused problems. This is invaluable for both novice and experienced users when troubleshooting after installing new software or drivers.

To access System Restore: 1. Type “Create a restore point” in the Start menu and select it. 2. In the System Properties window, click “System Restore.” 3. Follow the on-screen instructions to select a restore point and begin restoration.

Regularly create restore points before significant system changes. Advanced users can also automate restore point creation via Task Scheduler for additional safety.

How Do Windows Startup Repair and Safe Mode Assist in Recovery?

Windows Startup Repair automatically diagnoses and attempts to fix issues that prevent your PC from booting properly. If your system fails to start, Startup Repair can be accessed from the Windows Recovery Environment.

To use Startup Repair: 1. Interrupt the normal boot process three times to trigger Windows Recovery. 2. Select “Troubleshoot” > “Advanced options” > “Startup Repair.” 3. Choose your account and follow prompts.

Safe Mode loads Windows with minimal drivers and services, making it easier to run repairs and remove problematic software. Access it via the same “Advanced options” menu or by holding the Shift key while clicking “Restart” from the Start menu.

How Can Disk Cleanup and Storage Sense Keep Your System Healthy?

Junk files, outdated system files, and temporary data can clutter your hard drive and slow performance. Windows offers Disk Cleanup and Storage Sense for ongoing maintenance.

To use Disk Cleanup: 1. Search for “Disk Cleanup” and run the utility. 2. Select the drive you wish to clean. 3. Review and select file types to delete.

Storage Sense can be configured to automatically free up space by removing temporary files and emptying the Recycle Bin on a schedule. Go to: Settings > System > Storage > Configure Storage Sense or run it now.

How Does Glary Utilities Enhance Your Clean Up & Repair Routine?

While Windows provides robust built-in tools, [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) brings all these features together with additional automation and advanced options. Its 1-Click Maintenance scans for junk files, fixes registry errors, and identifies broken shortcuts. The Disk Repair, Registry Repair, and Startup Manager modules offer advanced diagnostics and optimization beyond what’s available in standard Windows utilities.

For example, after using SFC and DISM, running Glary Utilities’ Registry Repair can help resolve leftover registry inconsistencies. Its File Cleaner is often more thorough than Disk Cleanup, finding residual files that Windows tools may miss. By scheduling regular scans with Glary Utilities, users at all levels can automate essential system maintenance and lower the risk of unexpected issues.

Conclusion

Optimizing your Windows PC’s health doesn’t have to be complicated. By mastering these built-in repair tools and supplementing them with comprehensive solutions like [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com), you can ensure your system remains stable, fast, and secure. Regular use of these utilities, along with proactive cleanup and repair, is the key to long-term PC performance.
