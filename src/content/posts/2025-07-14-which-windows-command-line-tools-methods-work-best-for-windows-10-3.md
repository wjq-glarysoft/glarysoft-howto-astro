Windows 10 offers a rich arsenal of command line utilities that empower advanced users to manage, troubleshoot, and optimize their systems efficiently. Mastering these tools is essential for power users, system administrators, and IT professionals who want to go beyond the graphical interface. This article explores the most effective command line tools and methods, providing step-by-step examples to maximize productivity and control in Windows 10.

Why Use Command Line Tools for System Tasks?

Command line tools grant direct access to Windows internals, enabling batch scripting, automation, remote management, and granular control over system settings. They can resolve issues that the graphical interface cannot, and they often execute tasks faster with less overhead.

What Are the Best Built-in Command Line Tools in Windows 10?

1\. PowerShell

PowerShell is the powerhouse of Windows command line environments. It supports advanced scripting, task automation, and system administration.

Example: To list all installed services and export to a file:

Get-Service | Sort-Object Status | Export-Csv C:\\services.csv

You can also use PowerShell to manage Windows Updates, users, and groups.

2\. Command Prompt (CMD)

While PowerShell is more versatile, classic Command Prompt remains relevant for backward compatibility and legacy tools.

Example: To check disk health and repair file system errors:

chkdsk C: /f /r

3\. System File Checker (SFC) and Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool (DISM)

These tools verify and repair corrupt system files.

sfc /scannow DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth

Run SFC first to fix minor file corruption. If issues persist, use DISM to repair the Windows image.

4\. Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC)

WMIC allows querying system hardware, software, and configuration.

Example: To get the serial number of your machine:

wmic bios get serialnumber

5\. Tasklist and Taskkill

These help monitor and control running processes.

tasklist taskkill /IM notepad.exe /F

6\. Netsh

Netsh configures and diagnoses networking settings.

Example: To reset the TCP/IP stack:

netsh int ip reset

7\. SCHTASKS

Automate and schedule tasks from the command line.

Example: To schedule a weekly disk cleanup:

schtasks /create /tn "DiskCleanup" /tr "cleanmgr.exe /sagerun:1" /sc weekly /st 23:00

8\. FSUTIL

This tool handles advanced file and disk management tasks.

Example: To query free space on a drive:

fsutil volume diskfree C:

How Can You Combine Tools for Greater Effect?

One of the strengths of the command line is chaining commands with pipes and scripting for automation.

Example: To find the largest files in a directory and sort them:

powershell "Get-ChildItem C:\\Users\\YourName\\Downloads -Recurse | Sort-Object Length -Descending | Select-Object Name,Length -First 10"

For recurring maintenance, combine these tools in a batch or PowerShell script to run SFC, DISM, update definitions, and check disk health in sequence.

When Should You Use Third-Party System Tools?

While built-in tools are robust, third-party solutions like [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) offer enhanced functionality such as one-click system cleaning, advanced registry repair, and automated maintenance scheduling. [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) integrates key functions—including disk cleanup, startup management, and privacy protection—into a unified dashboard. This is especially helpful when you need comprehensive diagnostics and repair beyond what command line tools provide.

What are Best Practices for Using Command Line Tools Safely?

\- Always run the command prompt or PowerShell as Administrator for system-level changes. - Test commands in a virtual environment before deploying them widely. - Regularly backup important data before running repair or cleanup commands. - Use logging (e.g., command > log.txt) to keep records of changes for auditing and troubleshooting.

How Do You Stay Current With New Tools and Methods?

Microsoft regularly updates Windows 10 utilities and introduces new PowerShell cmdlets. Monitor official Microsoft documentation, subscribe to technical blogs, and participate in forums. Experiment with new switches and parameters in a test environment to deepen your expertise.

Summary

Advanced Windows 10 users who leverage command line tools like PowerShell, SFC, DISM, WMIC, and others gain unmatched control over their systems. Combining these with comprehensive utilities like [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) ensures thorough maintenance and optimization. Invest time in learning these tools, script repeatable tasks, and maintain best practices to keep your systems running at peak performance.
