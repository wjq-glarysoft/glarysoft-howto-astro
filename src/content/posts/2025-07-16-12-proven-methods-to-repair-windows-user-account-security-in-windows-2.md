This guide walks you through 12 proven methods to repair and enhance your Windows user account security, helping both beginners and advanced users safeguard their computers effectively.

For Beginners: Essential Security Repairs

A strong password is your first line of defense. To update your password:

\- Press Ctrl + Alt + Del and select "Change a password." - Enter your old password, then type and confirm your new, strong password (combine letters, numbers, and symbols). - Click OK.

Tip: Use a password manager for complex, unique passwords.

2\. What Is the Best Way to Turn On Windows Defender or Windows Security?

Windows Defender provides built-in protection:

\- Go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Security. - Click "Virus & threat protection." - Ensure "Real-time protection" is enabled.

This helps block unauthorized access to your user account.

Unused accounts can be exploited by attackers.

This reduces potential attack surfaces.

4\. How Do You Set Up Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) on Your Microsoft Account?

2FA adds another layer of security:

\- Visit https://account.microsoft.com/security - Sign in, select "Advanced security options." - Under "Additional security," turn on Two-step verification and follow the on-screen instructions.

This helps prevent unauthorized access even if your password is compromised.
