Configuring Windows system repair tools is essential for maintaining a healthy and efficient PC. With the correct setup, you can ensure your system is ready to handle any issues that may arise. Here are seven proven methods to configure Windows system repair tools effectively.

What are the Built-in Repair Tools in Windows?

Windows comes with several built-in tools designed to diagnose and fix various system issues. These include the System File Checker (SFC), Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool (DISM), and the Automatic Repair tool. Each serves a specific purpose and can be essential in maintaining your system's health. Understanding these tools is the first step in configuring them properly.

How to Use System File Checker (SFC)?

The System File Checker is a command-line tool that scans and repairs missing or corrupted system files. To use it:

1\. Open Command Prompt as an administrator. You can do this by typing "cmd" in the search box, right-clicking on Command Prompt, and selecting "Run as administrator." 2. In the Command Prompt window, type "sfc /scannow" and press Enter. 3. The tool will begin scanning. It may take some time, so be patient. Once completed, it will report any issues found and whether it was able to repair them.

Configuring the Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool (DISM)

DISM is another command-line utility that can be used to repair the Windows image, which SFC depends on to function correctly.

1\. Open Command Prompt as an administrator. 2. Run the following command to check for component store corruption: "DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth". 3. If corruption is detected, use "DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth" to fix the issues.

What is the Automatic Repair Tool?

The Automatic Repair tool is designed to troubleshoot startup issues. To configure it:

1\. Navigate to the Settings menu and select "Update & Security". 2. Click on "Recovery" and then "Restart now" under Advanced startup. 3. Your system will restart, and you'll be greeted with a menu. Choose "Troubleshoot", then "Advanced options", and finally "Startup Repair". 4. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the repair process.
