Are you noticing sluggish internet speeds or lag during online gaming and streaming sessions on your Windows 11 PC? Network performance isn’t just about having fast internet—your Windows settings and system condition play a huge role too. This guide walks you through the most effective ways to optimize your Windows 11 network performance, using proven best practices. Ideal for intermediate users, it covers hands-on tweaks, built-in tools, and third-party utilities to help you get the most from your connection.

Why is Network Performance Important on Windows 11?

Fast, reliable network performance means quicker downloads, smoother streaming, less buffering, and a better experience in online applications. Windows 11 introduces new networking features, but default settings may not always match your needs. Tuning these settings can unlock hidden speed and responsiveness.

What Built-in Windows 11 Features Can Boost Your Network?

1\. Update Your Network Drivers Outdated network drivers can bottleneck your connection. - Right-click the Start button and select Device Manager - Expand Network adapters - Right-click your adapter and choose Update driver - Select Search automatically for drivers If Windows finds an update, install it and reboot.

2\. Enable or Fine-Tune QoS (Quality of Service) Windows 11 supports QoS, allowing you to prioritize important network traffic. - Press Win + R, type gpedit.msc, and press Enter - Navigate to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Network > QoS Packet Scheduler - Double-click Limit reservable bandwidth - Select Enabled and set the bandwidth limit to 0% to ensure all your bandwidth is available for use

3\. Adjust Power Settings for Maximum Performance Network adapters may power down to save energy, affecting speed. - Go to Control Panel > Hardware and Sound > Power Options - Set your plan to High Performance - Click Change plan settings > Change advanced power settings - Under Wireless Adapter Settings, set Power Saving Mode to Maximum Performance

How Do TCP Tweaks Improve Network Speeds?

1\. Enable Large Send Offload (LSO) LSO lets network cards handle data segmentation, reducing CPU load. - Open Device Manager, expand Network adapters - Right-click your NIC > Properties - Under Advanced tab, locate Large Send Offload v2 (IPv4 and IPv6) - Set both to Enabled

2\. Disable Windows Auto-Tuning if Necessary Auto-Tuning improves throughput but can conflict with some routers or firewalls. - Open Command Prompt as Administrator - Run: netsh int tcp show global - If Receive Window Auto-Tuning Level is set to normal, test disabling it: netsh int tcp set global autotuninglevel=disabled - Test your speeds. If performance worsens, revert with: netsh int tcp set global autotuninglevel=normal

Can Third-Party Utilities Help with Network Optimization?

Absolutely. [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) offers a comprehensive suite of tools to optimize not just your network, but your entire system. With its built-in Network Optimizer, you can quickly tweak advanced settings without digging through obscure menus.
