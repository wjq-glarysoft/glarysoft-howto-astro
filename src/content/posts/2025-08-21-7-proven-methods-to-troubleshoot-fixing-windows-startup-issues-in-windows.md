When Windows refuses to start properly, it can feel frustrating and overwhelming. Startup problems often occur due to corrupted files, misconfigured settings, or damaged system components. The good news is that many of these issues can be resolved with systematic troubleshooting. Below are seven proven methods to fix Windows startup issues, explained in simple, step-by-step instructions that anyone can follow.

1\. How to Use Startup Repair from Advanced Options Windows provides a built-in Startup Repair tool designed to detect and fix problems that prevent your system from booting. Step 1: Restart your computer and press the power button again as it begins to load Windows to interrupt startup. Repeat this process two more times until you see the "Automatic Repair" screen. Step 2: Choose Advanced Options > Troubleshoot > Advanced Options > Startup Repair. Step 3: Select your Windows account and allow Windows to scan for issues. This tool automatically attempts to correct boot-related problems like missing or damaged system files.

2\. Can Safe Mode Help Identify the Problem? Safe Mode loads Windows with only essential drivers and services. If your PC starts in Safe Mode, it means the issue is likely related to drivers or third-party software. Step 1: From the Advanced Options menu, choose Startup Settings. Step 2: Select Restart, then press F4 to boot into Safe Mode. Step 3: Once inside Safe Mode, uninstall any recently installed programs or drivers that may have caused startup issues. This method helps isolate whether the startup failure is caused by external software or deeper system corruption.

3\. What If Boot Configuration Data Is Corrupted? Boot Configuration Data (BCD) errors are common reasons for startup failures. Fortunately, you can rebuild it. Step 1: Go to Advanced Options > Command Prompt. Step 2: Type: bootrec /fixmbr and press Enter. Step 3: Then type: bootrec /fixboot and press Enter. Step 4: Finally, type: bootrec /rebuildbcd and press Enter. These commands repair and rebuild essential boot records that Windows needs to load correctly.

4\. How to Run System File Checker and DISM Commands Corrupted system files often prevent Windows from starting normally. The System File Checker (SFC) and Deployment Imaging and Servicing Management (DISM) tools can restore them. Step 1: Open Command Prompt from Advanced Options. Step 2: Type: sfc /scannow and press Enter. Step 3: After SFC completes, type: DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth and press Enter. These scans automatically replace damaged or missing system files with healthy versions.

5\. Can Disk Errors Cause Startup Problems? Yes, hard drive issues can prevent Windows from booting properly. Running a disk check can repair these errors. Step 1: Open Command Prompt from Advanced Options. Step 2: Type: chkdsk C: /f /r and press Enter. Replace C: with the drive letter where Windows is installed if necessary. Step 3: Let the scan finish and restart your PC. This process checks for bad sectors, corrects file structure errors, and helps restore boot functionality.

6\. How Can Cleaning Up and Repairing Help? Cluttered temporary files, invalid registry entries, and leftover program fragments can slow down startup or even trigger boot issues. Using a reliable cleanup tool is a practical step. [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) is an excellent all-in-one solution for this purpose. Step 1: Install and open [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) once your PC is accessible through Safe Mode or after partial boot recovery. Step 2: Choose the "1-Click Maintenance" option. Step 3: Let the tool scan for issues like registry errors, broken shortcuts, temporary files, and startup program overload. Step 4: Click "Repair Problems" to fix them in bulk. By cleaning up unnecessary data and repairing invalid configurations, you reduce startup errors and improve overall performance.

7\. Is System Restore a Reliable Solution? If the problem began after a recent change, using System Restore can undo it. Step 1: From Advanced Options, select System Restore. Step 2: Choose a restore point created before the problem started. Step 3: Follow the on-screen instructions to revert Windows settings and system files. This method won’t affect your personal files, but it can roll back drivers, registry settings, and system updates that may have caused startup issues.

Troubleshooting Windows startup requires patience and systematic steps. By using built-in tools like Startup Repair, Safe Mode, and System File Checker, combined with clean up and repair solutions like [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com), most users can successfully resolve even stubborn issues. These methods provide a structured way to bring Windows back to a healthy, bootable state without unnecessary complexity.
