A fast and reliable network is essential for productivity, gaming, streaming, and file sharing on Windows 10 and 11. Network performance bottlenecks can lead to frustrating slowdowns, high ping, or even dropped connections. Whether you're a home user, gamer, or IT professional, optimizing your Windows network settings can make a substantial difference. Let’s explore the 12 most effective strategies to tune your Windows 10 or 11 network performance, with practical steps and professional-level insights.

Beginner Strategies

1\. Regularly Restart Your Router and PC

Why it matters: Over time, routers and computers can get bogged down by cached data, temporary glitches, and stalled processes.

How to do it: - Power off your router and PC for at least 10 seconds. - Restart both and reconnect to your network.

2\. Use Wired Connections Whenever Possible

Why it matters: Ethernet connections are generally faster and more stable than Wi-Fi.

How to do it: - Connect your PC directly to your router using a high-quality Ethernet cable. - If you must use Wi-Fi, position your PC closer to the router and minimize physical obstructions.

3\. Run the Windows Network Troubleshooter

Why it matters: Windows includes a built-in troubleshooter to resolve common network issues automatically.

How to do it: - Go to Settings > Network & Internet > Status. - Click ‘Network Troubleshooter’ and follow the prompts.

4\. Keep Network Drivers Updated

Why it matters: Outdated network drivers can cause connectivity issues or slow speeds.

How to do it: - Right-click Start > Device Manager. - Expand ‘Network adapters’. - Right-click your adapter > Update driver.

5\. Minimize Background Applications

Why it matters: Background apps can eat up bandwidth and system resources.

How to do it: - Press Ctrl+Shift+Esc to open Task Manager. - Check the ‘Processes’ tab for programs using network resources. - Right-click and ‘End task’ for unnecessary apps.

6\. Use Glary Utilities for Network and System Cleanup

Why it matters: Junk files, registry errors, and unnecessary startup items can indirectly affect network speed.

How to do it: - Download and install Glary Utilities. - Use the 1-Click Maintenance option, which cleans up junk files, repairs registry issues, and optimizes startup programs. - Go to ‘Advanced Tools’ > ‘Network’ to check your network settings and optimize connections.

Advanced Strategies

7\. Adjust Windows QoS (Quality of Service) Packet Scheduler

Why it matters: QoS can reserve bandwidth for certain services, which may limit overall network performance.

How to do it: - Press Win+R, type gpedit.msc, and hit Enter (Windows Pro editions). - Navigate to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Network > QoS Packet Scheduler. - Double-click ‘Limit reservable bandwidth’ and set it to ‘Enabled’ with a value of 0%.

8\. Disable Large Send Offload (LSO)

Why it matters: LSO can create latency issues in some network environments.

How to do it: - Open Device Manager > Network adapters. - Right-click your adapter > Properties > Advanced tab. - Locate ‘Large Send Offload’ or ‘LSO’ and set it to ‘Disabled’.

9\. Manually Set DNS Servers

Why it matters: Using faster, more reliable DNS servers can speed up web browsing and resolve sites faster.

How to do it: - Go to Settings > Network & Internet > Change Adapter Options. - Right-click your network connection > Properties. - Select ‘Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)’ > Properties. - Choose ‘Use the following DNS server addresses’. - Enter public DNS servers such as 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 (Google DNS) or 1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1 (Cloudflare).

10\. Tweak TCP Auto-Tuning

Why it matters: TCP Auto-Tuning can improve throughput on high-latency networks but may cause issues in some configurations.

How to do it: - Open Command Prompt as Administrator. - To view current status: netsh interface tcp show global - To disable: netsh interface tcp set global autotuninglevel=disabled - To enable (default): netsh interface tcp set global autotuninglevel=normal

Experiment to see which setting delivers the best results for your use case.

11\. Update Router Firmware and Optimize Router Settings

Why it matters: New firmware can fix bugs and improve performance.

How to do it: - Log in to your router’s admin interface (usually by entering 192.168.1.1 in your browser). - Check for firmware updates and apply if available. - Adjust settings like channel bandwidth or enable Quality of Service (QoS) for prioritizing crucial traffic, such as gaming or video calls.

12\. Monitor Network Traffic and Bandwidth Usage

Why it matters: Identifying bandwidth hogs or unusual activity helps you take targeted action.

How to do it: - Use Task Manager’s ‘Performance’ tab for a quick look. - For deeper analysis, use Windows Resource Monitor (type ‘resmon’ in the Start menu), or third-party tools like GlassWire. - Glary Utilities offers a network monitoring tool under ‘Advanced Tools’ > ‘Network’ so you can track bandwidth usage and spot suspicious activity.

Summary Table: Strategy Quick Reference

For Beginners: - Restart router/PC - Use wired connections - Run network troubleshooter - Update network drivers - Minimize background apps - Use [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) for cleanup and optimization

For Advanced Users: - Adjust QoS Packet Scheduler - Disable Large Send Offload - Set manual DNS servers - Tweak TCP Auto-Tuning - Update and optimize router firmware/settings - Monitor network traffic with in-depth tools
