Windows system repair tools are essential for maintaining the health and performance of your PC. However, these powerful utilities can be misused by malware, unauthorized users, or even by accident. Securing access to and the usage of these tools is crucial for both home users and administrators managing larger environments. In this article, we explore the top 10 ways to secure Windows system repair tools on Windows 10, offering easy steps for beginners and advanced tips for experienced users.

Why Secure System Repair Tools?

System repair tools—such as Command Prompt, System File Checker, System Restore, and third-party utilities like Glary Utilities—can fix or cause significant changes to your system. If left unsecured, these tools can be exploited to modify sensitive settings, delete critical files, or bypass security controls. Properly securing them helps protect your data, privacy, and system stability.

1\. Limit Local Administrator Accounts

For Beginners: If multiple people use your PC, ensure that only trusted users have administrator privileges. Go to Settings > Accounts > Family & other users, and check account types.

For Advanced Users: Use Local Group Policy Editor (gpedit.msc) to restrict administrative tool access. Remove unnecessary accounts from the Administrators group using lusrmgr.msc.

2\. Use Built-in Windows Security Features

For Beginners: Enable Windows Defender and keep it updated. Go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Security.

For Advanced Users: Configure Controlled Folder Access and Application Guard for added protection against unauthorized tool execution.

3\. Password-Protect BIOS and Boot Settings

For Beginners: Set a BIOS password to prevent booting from unauthorized devices. Usually, you can do this by pressing a key like F2 or Del during startup.

For Advanced Users: Disable booting from USB or CD/DVD in BIOS settings, so unauthorized users can’t load repair tools from external media.

4\. Employ Software Restriction Policies

For Advanced Users: Open gpedit.msc, navigate to Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Software Restriction Policies, and create rules to limit which users can run tools like cmd.exe, PowerShell, or regedit.

5\. Use Glary Utilities for Secure Clean Up & Repair

For Beginners: Download and install [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) from the official site. Its 1-Click Maintenance feature safely cleans up junk files, repairs registry errors, and manages startup programs, all within a secure, user-friendly environment.

For Advanced Users: Leverage [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com)’ advanced modules, such as Process Manager and File Shredder. You can set up Administrator passwords within Glary Utilities to restrict access to critical features.

6\. Keep Windows and Software Updated

For Beginners: Regularly check for Windows updates via Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update.

For Advanced Users: Apply group policies to force automatic updates and use PowerShell scripts for update management.

7\. Monitor Event Logs

For Beginners: Use Event Viewer (search for "Event Viewer" in the Start menu) to check for unusual activity, such as failed login attempts or unauthorized tool usage.

For Advanced Users: Set up custom event log alerts using Task Scheduler to notify you of suspicious activity related to system repair tools.

8\. Backup Regularly Before Repair

For Beginners: Create regular restore points: 1. Search for "Create a restore point" 2. Select your system drive 3. Click Configure > Turn on system protection > OK 4. Click Create and name your restore point

For Advanced Users: Use built-in tools or third-party solutions (like Glary Utilities' Backup Manager) to automate backups and safeguard against unintended changes during repairs.

9\. Restrict Access to System Folders

For Beginners: Don’t share or modify permissions for C:\\Windows or C:\\System32 folders unless absolutely necessary.

For Advanced Users: Use NTFS permissions and security auditing to monitor and restrict access to critical directories and executable files.

10\. Educate All Users

For Beginners: Discuss with family or colleagues about the importance of not using repair tools without proper knowledge.

For Advanced Users: Implement user training programs for staff. Use technology policies that cover acceptable use of system repair utilities.
