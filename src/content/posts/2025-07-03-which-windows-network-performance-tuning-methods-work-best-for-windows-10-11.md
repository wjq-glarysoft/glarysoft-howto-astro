A fast and reliable network connection is essential for everything from streaming and gaming to remote work and cloud backups. However, Windows 10 and 11 come with default network settings that prioritize compatibility and security—sometimes at the expense of maximum performance. For users seeking to optimize and improve their network performance, tuning Windows settings and using the right tools can make a significant difference. Let’s explore the most effective methods, from simple tweaks for beginners to advanced configurations for power users.

Why Tune Windows Network Performance?

Even on modern hardware, users can encounter slow downloads, lag in games, or glitches during video conferencing. These issues may be caused by local settings, outdated drivers, background applications, or inefficient network configurations. Proper tuning helps maximize the speed and reliability of your connection, reduce latency, and ensure smooth online experiences.

Network Performance Tuning: Essential Steps for Beginners

1\. Keep Windows and Drivers Updated

One of the most overlooked steps is ensuring Windows and your network drivers are up to date. Microsoft and hardware manufacturers frequently release updates that resolve performance and compatibility issues.

Steps: - Open Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update, and check for updates. - For drivers, right-click the Start button, select Device Manager, expand Network adapters, right-click your adapter, and choose Update Driver.

2\. Use Wired Connections When Possible

A direct Ethernet connection almost always provides better speed and lower latency than Wi-Fi. If you’re gaming, streaming, or transferring large files, connect your PC to your router with a cable.

3\. Remove Bandwidth-Hogging Background Apps

Applications running in the background can consume significant bandwidth. Common culprits include Windows updates, cloud synchronization, and torrent clients.

Practical example: - Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager. - Go to the Processes tab and look for any apps using network resources. - End unnecessary tasks, or configure their settings to limit bandwidth use during busy times.

4\. Adjust Power Settings

Windows sometimes reduces network adapter performance to save energy. For best results, set your power plan to High Performance.

How to do it: - Type “power plan” in Windows Search and select Choose a power plan. - Set to High Performance. - Click Change plan settings > Change advanced power settings. - Expand Wireless Adapter Settings and set Power Saving Mode to Maximum Performance.

Intermediate Tuning Techniques

1\. Optimize TCP/IP Settings Automatically

The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) stack governs how Windows communicates over the network. Over time, these settings can become suboptimal.

How Glary Utilities Helps: Glary Utilities offers a one-click Internet Booster tool that automatically detects and adjusts network parameters like MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit), RWIN (TCP Receive Window), and more, based on your connection type.

Steps: - Download and install [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com). - Open the program and select the Advanced Tools tab. - Click on Internet Booster, follow the prompts, and let it optimize your settings.

2\. Disable Large Send Offload and Other Adapter Features

Some network adapter settings like Large Send Offload (LSO) and Interrupt Moderation are designed for specific environments but can cause latency or throughput issues for home users.

How to adjust: - Open Device Manager > Network adapters. - Right-click your adapter > Properties > Advanced tab. - Set Large Send Offload (IPv4 and IPv6) to Disabled. - Optionally, experiment with other settings like Receive Side Scaling (RSS) and TCP Checksum Offload for your usage.

3\. Adjust Windows QoS Settings

Windows reserves a percentage of your bandwidth for system processes by default. You can reduce or disable this reservation to make more bandwidth available for your own activities.

Steps: - Press Win + R, type gpedit.msc, and press Enter (not available in Windows Home editions). - Navigate to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Network > QoS Packet Scheduler. - Double-click Limit reservable bandwidth, set to Enabled, and lower the value to 0.

Advanced Methods for Power Users

1\. Fine-tune MTU and RWIN Values

The Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) and TCP Receive Window (RWIN) determine packet size and buffer capacity. Incorrect values can lead to fragmentation or throughput bottlenecks.

Example: - To find the optimal MTU, open Command Prompt as administrator and run: ping www.google.com -f -l 1472

Reduce the 1472 value in increments of 10 until you get a reply without fragmentation, then add 28 to your last successful value for your optimal MTU.

\- To set the MTU, use:

netsh interface ipv4 set subinterface "Ethernet" mtu=XXXX store=persistent

2\. Use Third-party Tools for Comprehensive Cleanup and Optimization

A clean, efficiently running PC is less likely to suffer from background processes that sap network performance. [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) can help here as well, offering:

\- Startup Manager: Disable network-heavy apps from loading on boot. - Disk Cleaner: Remove unnecessary files that may interact with cloud services or updates. - Process Manager: Identify and control bandwidth-heavy background processes.

3\. Network Profile and Firewall Optimization

Make sure your network is set to Private (if safe), allowing for more streamlined network communication. Also, review Windows Defender Firewall rules to ensure no unnecessary blocks are affecting legitimate apps.

How to set Network Profile: - Open Settings > Network & Internet > Status. - Click on Properties under your connection and select Private.

For advanced firewall configuration, use Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security from the Start menu.

Summary: Combining Tools and Manual Tweaks for Best Results

Boosting Windows 10 and 11 network performance is a mix of smart configuration, up-to-date drivers, and periodic system cleanup. Beginners can see immediate improvements with simple steps like updating software, prioritizing wired connections, and cleaning up background apps. Intermediate users benefit from network adapter tweaks and automated tools like Glary Utilities’ Internet Booster. Power users can gain further speed by fine-tuning advanced TCP/IP parameters and managing system resources more granularly.

Regular maintenance—including using comprehensive utilities like Glary Utilities—ensures your network stays in top shape, providing the speed, reliability, and responsiveness you expect from modern Windows systems.
