When your Windows PC starts lagging online, slow downloads, buffering videos, and dropped connections can waste precious time and disrupt productivity. Fortunately, there are numerous ways to optimize and improve your network performance in Windows—many of which are fast and easy to implement. This guide covers 15 essential tips, offering straightforward advice for beginners and more technical tweaks for advanced users. Whether you’re a casual user or a tech enthusiast, these time-saving strategies will help you get the best possible speed and reliability from your Windows machine.

Beginner Tips: Easy Network Performance Boosts

1\. Restart Your Router and PC Regularly Sometimes the simplest solution is the most effective. Restart your router at least once a week to clear its memory and refresh the connection. Equally, reboot your PC to close background processes that might interfere with your network.

2\. Keep Windows and Network Drivers Updated Outdated drivers and system files can slow down your network connection. Windows Update often includes network optimizations, and new drivers from your device manufacturer can resolve bottlenecks. To update drivers: - Right-click the Start button and select Device Manager - Expand "Network adapters" - Right-click your adapter and choose "Update driver"

3\. Use Wired Connections Whenever Possible Wi-Fi is convenient but often less stable and slower than wired Ethernet. If possible, connect your PC directly to the router with an Ethernet cable for maximum speed and minimal interference.

4\. Limit Background Apps Consuming Bandwidth Some apps, like cloud storage clients or streaming services, can run in the background and use up your bandwidth. To check: - Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager - Go to the "Processes" tab - Look for apps using high network resources and close or pause unnecessary ones

5\. Use the Built-in Windows Troubleshooter Windows includes troubleshooting tools to detect and fix network issues. Go to Settings > Update & Security > Troubleshoot > Additional troubleshooters > Internet Connections Run the troubleshooter and follow on-screen instructions for quick fixes.

Intermediate Tips: Taking Control of Your Network

6\. Optimize Your DNS Settings Default DNS servers from your ISP may not be the fastest. Switching to public DNS servers like Google (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4) or Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) can improve web browsing speed. To change DNS: - Open Control Panel > Network and Sharing Center > Change adapter settings - Right-click your connection > Properties > Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) - Select "Use the following DNS server addresses" and enter your preferred DNS

7\. Disable Metered Connection (If You Have Unlimited Data) Windows can limit bandwidth for system updates and apps on metered connections. If you have unlimited data, make sure your connection is not set as metered. Go to Settings > Network & Internet > Wi-Fi/Ethernet > Your connection > Turn off "Set as metered connection"

8\. Adjust Network Adapter Power Settings By default, Windows may reduce the power to your network adapter to save energy, which can affect speed. - Go to Device Manager > Network adapters > Right-click your adapter > Properties - Under "Power Management," uncheck "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power"

9\. Prioritize Bandwidth for Important Apps (QoS) Quality of Service (QoS) settings can help prioritize network traffic for certain apps, reducing lag for gaming, video calls, or downloads. Check your router’s admin interface for QoS options, or use Windows Group Policy Editor for advanced network prioritization.

10\. Use [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) for Network Optimization Glary Utilities offers tools to clean up junk files, manage startup programs, and optimize your internet settings—all of which can improve network performance. For example, use Glary Utilities’ "Internet Booster" to analyze and adjust settings for faster browsing, or run its "Startup Manager" to prevent unnecessary apps from slowing your network at boot.

Advanced Tips: Power Tweaks for Experienced Users

11\. Disable Large Send Offload and Other Advanced Adapter Features Some network adapter settings like "Large Send Offload" or "Interrupt Moderation" can cause latency. - Go to Device Manager > Network adapters > Adapter Properties > Advanced - Disable "Large Send Offload," "Interrupt Moderation," or test different settings for the best results

12\. Tweak Windows TCP/IP Settings Windows TCP settings can be fine-tuned for better throughput. Power users can use tools like "netsh" in Command Prompt: - Open Command Prompt as administrator - Run: netsh int tcp set global autotuninglevel=normal Experiment with "autotuninglevel" values (disabled, highlyrestricted, normal) to find what works best.

13\. Disable Windows Auto-Tuning If Experiencing Inconsistent Speeds Network auto-tuning can cause issues with some routers. To turn it off: - Open Command Prompt as administrator - Run: netsh int tcp set global autotuninglevel=disabled Test performance, and re-enable with "normal" if needed.

14\. Set Static IP for Faster Local Network Communication Assigning a static IP can speed up local network discovery for file sharing or printing. - Go to Network adapter properties > IPv4 settings - Select "Use the following IP address" and enter a value outside your router’s DHCP range

15\. Regular Maintenance with Glary Utilities Consistent cleanup, registry optimization, and startup management can prevent background processes from hogging bandwidth. Glary Utilities’ "One-Click Maintenance" consolidates these tasks, saving you time and keeping your PC running at peak network performance.

Final Thoughts

Whether you’re struggling with slow downloads, laggy online games, or unreliable video calls, these 15 network performance tuning tips can help. For beginners, simple steps like restarting your router, updating drivers, and limiting background apps provide quick wins. Intermediate and advanced users can dive into DNS optimization, QoS, and TCP/IP tweaks for even more control.

Don’t forget all-in-one solutions like [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com), which streamline regular maintenance and provide handy tools for both system and network optimization. With these time-saving strategies, you’ll spend less time troubleshooting and more time enjoying a fast, reliable Windows network experience.
