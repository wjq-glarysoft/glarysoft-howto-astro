Windows operating systems are generally robust, but over time, you may encounter slowdowns, errors, or system instability due to software conflicts, corrupted files, or leftover junk. Knowing how to use system repair tools—both native to Windows and third-party utilities—can help restore your PC’s performance and reliability. This guide offers practical, step-by-step instructions for intermediate users, covering basic and advanced solutions for clean up and repair.

Why Should You Use System Repair Tools?

System repair tools can fix common problems like slow boot times, application crashes, and corrupted files. Regular maintenance not only resolves issues but can prevent them, extending your PC’s life and improving your user experience.

What Are the Essential Built-in Windows Repair Tools?

Windows includes several tools to address system problems. Here’s how to use them effectively:

1\. System File Checker (SFC)

SFC scans for and repairs missing or corrupted system files.

Step-by-Step:

1\. Press Win+S, type cmd, right-click Command Prompt, and select “Run as administrator.” 2. Type sfc /scannow and press Enter. 3. Wait for the scan to finish. If issues are found, SFC will attempt repairs automatically. 4. Reboot your PC to complete the process.

Example: If your Windows apps start crashing or showing strange errors, SFC is a reliable first check.

2\. Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM)

DISM can fix deeper component store corruption that SFC can’t handle.

Step-by-Step:

1\. Open Command Prompt as administrator. 2. Type DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth and press Enter. 3. Allow the process to finish, which may take some time. 4. Afterward, run SFC again for a thorough repair.

When to Use: If SFC reports errors it cannot fix, DISM is your next line of defense.

3\. Windows Startup Repair

If your PC fails to boot correctly, Startup Repair can often fix boot issues.

Step-by-Step:

1\. Hold Shift and restart your computer via the Start menu. 2. Select Troubleshoot > Advanced options > Startup Repair. 3. Choose your Windows account and enter your password. 4. Follow the prompts to finish the repair.

Common Use: This is useful if you see a blue or black screen at startup with error messages.
