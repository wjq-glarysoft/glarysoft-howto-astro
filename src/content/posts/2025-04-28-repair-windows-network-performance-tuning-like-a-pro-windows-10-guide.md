When it comes to enhancing your Windows 10 network performance, many users often overlook or misconfigure settings that could lead to suboptimal performance. This guide will help intermediate users identify common mistakes and apply practical solutions for optimal network performance.

What Are the Common Network Performance Mistakes?

1\. Ignoring Network Adapter Settings: Many users fail to optimize their network adapter settings, which can hinder performance. For instance, leaving "Energy Efficient Ethernet" enabled may save power, but it can also reduce network speed.

Solution: Access your network adapter settings through the Device Manager. Right-click your network adapter, select 'Properties', and then navigate to the 'Advanced' tab. Disable 'Energy Efficient Ethernet' and enable features like 'Jumbo Frames' if your network supports them.

2\. Overlooking Driver Updates: Outdated network drivers can lead to connectivity issues or slower speeds. Many users neglect to update their drivers regularly.

Solution: Regularly check for updates by visiting your network adapter manufacturer's website or using Windows Update to keep your drivers current. Glary Utilities can automate this process with its software update checker, ensuring you never miss an update.

3\. Misconfiguring TCP/IP Settings: Incorrect TCP/IP settings can bottleneck your network speed. Some users might disable features like 'Receive Window Auto-Tuning', thinking it improves performance, when it actually can enhance throughput.

Solution: Use the Command Prompt to ensure 'Receive Window Auto-Tuning' is enabled. Type \`netsh int tcp show global\` and verify the 'Receive Window Auto-Tuning Level' is set to normal. Adjust it using \`netsh int tcp set global autotuninglevel=normal\` if needed.

4\. Failing to Manage Background Apps: Applications running in the background can consume bandwidth, slowing down your network speed.

Solution: Use the Task Manager to review which apps are using network resources. Close unnecessary applications. Additionally, [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) can help manage startup programs, ensuring only essential apps run, freeing up bandwidth.

5\. Overlooking the Importance of DNS Configuration: Using slow DNS servers can negatively impact browsing speed. Many users stick with their ISP's default DNS, which may not be the fastest.

Solution: Test alternative DNS services like Google DNS (8.8.8.8) or Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) to see if they offer better speeds. Change your DNS settings through the Network & Internet settings in Windows 10 for improved performance.
