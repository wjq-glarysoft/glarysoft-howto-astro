Windows offers a robust networking stack, but default settings often aren’t optimized for every user’s needs. Whether you’re aiming for faster file transfers, smoother gaming, or more reliable video calls, network performance tuning can make a big difference. This guide covers practical, step-by-step advice for tuning Windows network performance, with sections for both beginners and advanced users. We’ll also highlight how Glary Utilities can help streamline some of these tasks for all skill levels.

Why Tune Network Performance in Windows?

Network performance affects how quickly you can upload or download files, how smooth your streaming and gaming experiences are, and even the reliability of cloud-based work. Poorly tuned settings or network clutter can lead to slowdowns, increased latency, or instability. Optimizing your Windows network settings can resolve many of these issues.

Beginner Section: Easy Steps to Boost Network Performance

1\. Run the Windows Network Troubleshooter

Windows includes built-in troubleshooting tools that can automatically detect and fix common network issues.

\- Open Settings > Network & Internet > Status. - Click Network troubleshooter and follow the prompts. - Windows will attempt to identify and resolve issues such as incorrect settings or outdated drivers.

2\. Keep Network Drivers Updated

Outdated drivers can cause slow speeds or dropped connections.

\- Right-click the Start button, choose Device Manager. - Expand the Network adapters section. - Right-click your network device, select Update driver. - Choose Search automatically for drivers. - Restart your PC after updating.

3\. Reduce Startup Programs that Use Network Bandwidth

Some applications start automatically and consume bandwidth in the background.

\- Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager. - Click the Startup tab. - Disable unnecessary programs (especially cloud backups or updaters).

Glary Utilities Makes This Easier:

Glary Utilities offers a Startup Manager feature to easily disable or delay startup programs, helping to reduce background network usage.

4\. Clean Up Network-Related Junk

Temporary files and leftover network cache can sometimes slow down network operations.

\- Open Glary Utilities. - Select 1-Click Maintenance. - Ensure Temporary Files Cleaner and Tracks Eraser are checked. - Run the scan and clean up as recommended.

Intermediate and Advanced Section: Fine-Tuning Windows Network Settings

1\. Adjust TCP/IP Settings

Windows’ default TCP settings may not be optimal for all users, especially on high-speed or high-latency connections.

\- Open Command Prompt as Administrator. - To view current TCP settings: netsh int tcp show global - To enable TCP Auto-Tuning (recommended for most broadband users): netsh int tcp set global autotuninglevel=normal - To disable (only if you experience issues): netsh int tcp set global autotuninglevel=disabled

Restart your computer after making changes.

2\. Disable Large Send Offload and Other Offloading Features

Network adapters offload some processing from the CPU, but this can sometimes cause issues.

\- Open Device Manager. - Right-click your network adapter, choose Properties. - Go to the Advanced tab. - Find Large Send Offload (IPv4/IPv6) and set to Disabled. - Also consider disabling TCP Checksum Offload and UDP Checksum Offload if troubleshooting latency.

Test your network performance after each setting change.

3\. Prioritize Network Traffic with QoS (Quality of Service)

Windows Pro and above allow Group Policy edits for bandwidth management, which is useful for prioritizing gaming, VoIP, or streaming.

\- Press Win + R, type gpedit.msc, and press Enter. - Navigate to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Network > QoS Packet Scheduler. - Double-click Limit reservable bandwidth, set it to Enabled. - Set the Bandwidth limit (%) to 0 for maximum available bandwidth.

4\. Clear DNS Cache for Faster Browsing

Outdated DNS cache can cause slow site loading.

\- Open Command Prompt as Administrator. - Type ipconfig /flushdns and press Enter.

Alternatively, Glary Utilities provides an easy-to-use Tracks Eraser to clear DNS cache and other residuals.

Tips for All Users: Monitoring and Ongoing Maintenance

\- Regularly scan for malware with Windows Defender or a trusted third-party tool, as malware can hijack bandwidth. - Monitor network usage in Task Manager (under the Performance tab) to identify resource-heavy apps. - Use Glary Utilities’ Network Monitor to track bandwidth use and connections.

Troubleshooting Example: Slow LAN File Transfers

If you notice very slow file sharing or transfer speeds between PCs on your local network:

\- Ensure both PCs are set to the same speed (100Mbps or 1Gbps) in the network adapter properties. - Disable Large Send Offload on both machines. - Temporarily disable antivirus or firewall to test if they are the bottleneck.
