Are you frustrated with a Windows PC that refuses to start smoothly or takes forever to boot? Startup issues are common, but with the right tools and strategies, most can be resolved without resorting to a full system reinstall. This guide provides intermediate Windows users with practical, time-saving advice on diagnosing and fixing startup problems using built-in Windows tools, as well as third-party solutions like Glary Utilities.

What are the Most Common Windows Startup Issues?

Before diving into solutions, it’s helpful to know what you might be dealing with. Common startup issues include:

\- Black or blank screens during boot - Endless loading or “spinning circles” - Error messages (like “INACCESSIBLE\_BOOT\_DEVICE”) - Slow startup due to background apps or junk files

Knowing the symptoms helps you pick the right solution quickly.

How Can You Use Safe Mode to Diagnose the Problem?

Safe Mode is a minimal Windows environment that loads only essential drivers and services.

1\. Restart your PC. 2. As it starts, press F8 (or hold Shift while clicking Restart from the login screen for Windows 10/11). 3. Choose “Troubleshoot” > “Advanced options” > “Startup Settings” > Restart. 4. Select “Enable Safe Mode.”

If your PC starts in Safe Mode, the issue is likely caused by a non-essential app, driver, or service. From here, you can uninstall recently added programs, roll back drivers, or use diagnostic tools.

What Windows Tools Can Help Repair Startup Problems Quickly?

Several built-in Windows tools can resolve startup issues:

Startup Repair: - From the Safe Mode menu, select “Troubleshoot” > “Advanced options” > “Startup Repair.” - Follow the on-screen instructions. Windows will attempt to resolve boot configuration problems automatically.

System File Checker (SFC) and DISM: - Open Command Prompt as administrator. - Run: sfc /scannow - After that completes, run: DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth These commands repair corrupted system files that might be causing startup errors.

Task Manager - Startup Tab: Sometimes, unnecessary startup programs slow down your PC. - Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager. - Click the “Startup” tab. - Disable any non-essential or suspicious programs (right-click > Disable).

How Does [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) Speed Up Windows Startup Repair?

While Windows offers good built-in tools, Glary Utilities provides an all-in-one solution for ongoing maintenance and faster problem resolution.

Startup Manager: - Open [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com). - Go to “Startup Manager” under the “Optimize & Improve” section. - Review the list of startup items. Disable or delay unneeded programs with a single click. - This speeds up boot time and can stop problematic apps from launching.

Registry Cleaner and Repair: - Under “Clean Up & Repair,” use the Registry Cleaner. - Scan and fix registry errors that may contribute to startup failures.

One-Click Maintenance: - Use the “1-Click Maintenance” feature for quick cleanup of junk files, broken shortcuts, and temp files. - Regular use prevents clutter that can slow down or crash startup processes.

Practical example: If your PC recently started taking five minutes to load after installing new software, use Glary Utilities’ Startup Manager to disable the new app’s auto-start entry, and run the Registry Cleaner to remove any leftover invalid entries.

When Should You Consider a System Restore or Reset?

If you can’t resolve the issue with the above methods, a System Restore can roll back your PC to a working state.

\- Go to “Troubleshoot” > “Advanced options” > “System Restore.” - Pick a restore point from before your startup problems began.

As a last resort, Windows’ “Reset this PC” feature reinstalls Windows while keeping your files—saving you from a full wipe.

What Maintenance Habits Can Prevent Future Startup Issues?

\- Regularly run Glary Utilities’ 1-Click Maintenance to clear junk, fix registry errors, and manage startup programs. - Keep Windows updated and drivers current. - Avoid installing unnecessary or untrusted software.

Summary

Most startup issues can be fixed without losing data or wasting hours. Use Safe Mode for troubleshooting, built-in tools like Startup Repair and SFC for repairs, and Glary Utilities for ongoing maintenance and fast fixes. By following these steps, you can keep your Windows system running smoothly and booting quickly with minimal downtime.
