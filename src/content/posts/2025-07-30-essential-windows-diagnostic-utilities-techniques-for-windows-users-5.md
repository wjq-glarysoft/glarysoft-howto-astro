What Are Windows Diagnostic Utilities, and Why Should You Use Them?

Diagnostic utilities are specialized system tools that help detect faults, monitor resource usage, test hardware and software reliability, and troubleshoot problems. Regular use of these tools not only prevents minor issues from escalating but also enhances your computer’s longevity and efficiency.

For beginners, these utilities can provide a simple way to check disk health, manage startup items, and fix common errors. Advanced users can leverage them for in-depth performance monitoring, driver management, and network troubleshooting.

Essential Diagnostic Utilities and Techniques for Beginners

How Can Beginners Use the Windows Task Manager?

The Task Manager is the first line of defense for most Windows users. To open it, press Ctrl + Shift + Esc or right-click the taskbar and select Task Manager.

\- Check running processes: Use the Processes tab to identify resource-hungry applications. - End unresponsive tasks: Right-click an unresponsive app and select End task. - Monitor system performance: The Performance tab displays real-time graphs for CPU, memory, disk, and network usage.

When your PC feels slow, Task Manager quickly shows if a specific application is causing the slowdown.

How Can You Use Windows Memory Diagnostic?

Frequent crashes or blue screen errors may be due to faulty RAM. To run Windows Memory Diagnostic:

1\. Press Windows key + R, type mdsched.exe, and hit Enter. 2. Choose to restart now and check for problems.

The PC will reboot and automatically test your memory. After completion, check the results in the Event Viewer under Windows Logs > System.

What Is the Role of Check Disk (CHKDSK)?

Check Disk scans and repairs file system errors on your hard drives—vital for preventing data loss.

1\. Open Command Prompt as administrator. 2. Type chkdsk C: /f /r and press Enter (replace C: with your drive letter).

You may need to restart your PC for the scan to run. It's a straightforward way to resolve disk-related issues like corrupted files or bad sectors.
