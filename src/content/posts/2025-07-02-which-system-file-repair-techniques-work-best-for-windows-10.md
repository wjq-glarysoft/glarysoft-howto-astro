Windows 10 is a powerful, flexible operating system, but over time, important system files can become damaged or corrupted. This can cause slowdowns, crashes, or strange behavior in your PC. If you suspect system file issues, there are several effective repair techniques you can use to restore your computer to full health. This article will introduce you to the best methods for repairing system files in Windows 10, with practical steps, beginner-friendly explanations, and more advanced options for experienced users.

Why Should You Repair System Files?

System files are the core files that keep Windows running. If they get damaged due to unexpected shutdowns, malware, failed updates, or software conflicts, your system may not behave as expected. Repairing these files can fix many problems such as:

\- Slow or unresponsive programs - Random error messages - Windows features not working properly - Frequent crashes or blue screens

Where Should Beginners Start?

For most users, it’s best to start with simple, built-in tools before moving to more advanced techniques.

Running System File Checker (SFC) – Beginner

SFC is a built-in Windows tool that scans and repairs corrupted system files. Here’s how to use it:

1\. Right-click the Start button and select “Windows Terminal (Admin)” or “Command Prompt (Admin)”. 2. In the command window, type: sfc /scannow 3. Press Enter. 4. Wait for the scan to complete (this may take 10-30 minutes). 5. If SFC finds any issues, it will attempt to repair them automatically. When it’s done, restart your computer.

Real-World Example: If your computer is suddenly slow and you receive errors like “Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files and successfully repaired them”, SFC was able to fix the problem.

What If SFC Can't Fix Everything? – Intermediate

Sometimes, SFC can’t repair all files, especially if the damage is severe. In this case, try the Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool (DISM).

Using DISM to Repair Windows Images

1\. Open Windows Terminal (Admin) or Command Prompt (Admin) as described above. 2. Type the following command: DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth 3. Press Enter and wait for the process to complete (usually 10-30 minutes). 4. When finished, restart your computer and run SFC again to double-check the repair.

DISM downloads replacement files from Windows Update, so make sure you have an internet connection.
