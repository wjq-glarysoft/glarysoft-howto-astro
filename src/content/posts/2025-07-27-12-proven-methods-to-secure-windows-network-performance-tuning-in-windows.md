Quality of Service (QoS) can reserve bandwidth for system tasks, sometimes limiting available bandwidth for other uses.

Step-by-Step: - Press Windows + R and type gpedit.msc to open Group Policy Editor. - Navigate to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Network > QoS Packet Scheduler. - Double-click Limit reservable bandwidth. - Set it to Enabled and change the bandwidth limit to 0%.

8\. Tweak TCP/IP Settings

For power users, customizing TCP/IP settings can improve throughput.

Step-by-Step: - Open Command Prompt as Administrator. - To enable TCP Window Auto-Tuning, type: netsh interface tcp set global autotuninglevel=normal - To reset if needed, use: netsh interface tcp set global autotuninglevel=disabled

9\. Disable Large Send Offload (LSO)

LSO can cause latency issues in some configurations.

Step-by-Step: - Right-click Start, select Device Manager. - Expand Network adapters, right-click your adapter, and select Properties. - Go to Advanced, scroll to Large Send Offload, and set it to Disabled.

10\. Scan for Malware and Network Hijackers

Malware can secretly use your bandwidth or throttle performance.

Step-by-Step: - Open Windows Security and run a Full Scan. - For deeper cleaning, use Glary Utilities’ Malware Removal tool.

Benefit: - Glary Utilities scans for and removes threats that traditional tools might miss.

11\. Fine-tune the Hosts File and DNS Cache

Corrupted or bloated hosts files and DNS caches can slow connections.

Step-by-Step: - To clear the DNS cache, open Command Prompt as Administrator and type: ipconfig /flushdns - For hosts file cleanup, open C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts in Notepad and remove unnecessary entries.

12\. Manage Network Startup Programs

Programs that auto-start and connect to the internet can slow your network at boot.

Step-by-Step: - Open Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc). - Go to the Startup tab. - Disable unnecessary programs, especially those with high network impact. - Glary Utilities’ Startup Manager provides an easier interface and recommendations for safe disabling.

Pro Tips for Both Beginners and Advanced Users

\- Regularly update your router’s firmware. - Use strong, unique Wi-Fi passwords to avoid unauthorized access. - Monitor network usage via Windows Task Manager (Performance tab > Ethernet or Wi-Fi).
