Why Should You Enhance Privacy on Windows?

Windows is a powerful and flexible operating system, but it collects and processes a lot of user data by default. Even if you adjust some privacy settings during installation, Windows often continues to transmit diagnostics, app usage, and location information to Microsoft. For intermediate users who value privacy and want to keep sensitive data secure, taking additional steps is essential. Here are five advanced, practical tips to help you significantly boost your Windows privacy and security.

How Can You Minimize Telemetry and Diagnostic Data Sharing?

Windows telemetry collects diagnostic and usage data to improve system performance, but it shares this data with Microsoft servers. To limit this:

1\. Open Settings, navigate to Privacy & security, then to Diagnostics & feedback. 2. Set Send optional diagnostic data to Off, so only the minimum required data is sent. 3. Scroll down to Delete diagnostic data and click Delete. 4. Consider disabling Feedback frequency by setting it to Never.

For more control, use the Group Policy Editor (Windows Pro/Enterprise):

1\. Press Windows + R, type gpedit.msc, and press Enter. 2. Go to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Data Collection and Preview Builds. 3. Double-click Allow Telemetry, set it to Disabled, and click OK.

This will prevent most telemetry data from being sent to Microsoft.

What Advanced Steps Can You Take to Limit App Permissions?

Many apps request access to resources like your camera, microphone, contacts, and calendar. Review and restrict these permissions for enhanced privacy.

1\. Go to Settings > Privacy & security. 2. Under App permissions, click each category (Camera, Microphone, etc.). 3. Turn off access for apps that don’t require these permissions.

For even more granular control, review background app permissions:

1\. In Privacy & security, click Background apps. 2. Disable apps you don’t want running or collecting data in the background.

This approach ensures only trusted apps have access to sensitive hardware and personal data.

How Do You Harden Your Network Privacy with DNS and Firewall Tweaks?

Windows sends some data over your network that could be tracked or intercepted. You can improve privacy by:

1\. Configuring a privacy-focused DNS service like Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) or Google DNS (8.8.8.8). - Go to Settings > Network & Internet > Ethernet or Wi-Fi > Hardware properties. - Click Edit under DNS server assignment, choose Manual, and enter your preferred DNS addresses. 2. Use the built-in Windows Defender Firewall to block outgoing connections for apps that don’t need internet access. - Open Windows Security, go to Firewall & network protection, and select Allow an app through firewall. - Uncheck unnecessary apps or click Change settings for more control.

For advanced users, consider using a third-party firewall tool to review and manage all outgoing network connections.

What Is the Role of the Hosts File in Blocking Tracking Domains?

The Windows hosts file can redirect or block known tracking domains, stopping apps and system processes from connecting to them.

1\. Open Notepad as Administrator. 2. Open C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts. 3. Add lines such as: 127.0.0.1 telemetry.microsoft.com 127.0.0.1 ads.example.com

You can find regularly updated lists of tracking and telemetry domains online. Save the file and restart your computer. Be careful when editing the hosts file and only block domains you’re sure are safe to redirect.

How Can Glary Utilities Help Manage Privacy More Efficiently?

While Windows provides many privacy settings, managing them individually can be time-consuming and complex. [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) offers a dedicated Privacy & Security module that centralizes and simplifies these privacy controls.

With [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com), you can:

\- Use the Tracks Eraser tool to erase usage traces, browser history, and cookies across multiple browsers in one click. - Securely delete files with File Shredder, ensuring sensitive data is unrecoverable. - Manage and clean up old system logs, MRU lists, and registry entries that may expose your activity. - Use the Startup Manager to disable unnecessary auto-start apps that may collect data in the background.

Glary Utilities provides user-friendly dashboards and automation options, making regular privacy maintenance fast and efficient for intermediate Windows users.

Conclusion

Enhancing your privacy on Windows requires more than just the default settings. By controlling telemetry, managing app permissions, strengthening your network privacy, editing the hosts file, and leveraging tools like Glary Utilities, you can take charge of your data and minimize potential privacy risks. Regular audits and updates to these settings will keep your system secure and your personal information protected.
