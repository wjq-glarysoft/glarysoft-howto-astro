Keeping your Windows system clean and optimized is not just about saving space; it’s about saving time and keeping your computer performing at its best. Intermediate Windows users often juggle multiple applications, large files, and demanding workloads, so efficiency matters. Here are 15 practical, time-saving tips to keep your Windows system’s storage and performance in top shape.

1\. Use Storage Sense for Automatic Cleaning Windows 10 and 11 include Storage Sense, which can automatically clear temporary files, empty the recycle bin, and remove old downloads on a schedule. Go to Settings > System > Storage and enable Storage Sense to save yourself from manually deleting clutter.

2\. Run Disk Cleanup for Quick Wins Disk Cleanup is still a fast, built-in way to remove system junk. Press Windows + S, search for Disk Cleanup, and select the drive you want to clean. Check boxes for temporary files, system cache, and previous Windows installations for immediate space recovery.

3\. Clear the WinSxS Folder Without Risk WinSxS holds Windows update backups that can grow large. Open Command Prompt as an administrator and run: DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup This keeps only the latest update components, saving gigabytes.

4\. Uninstall Rarely Used Applications Go to Control Panel > Programs and Features or Settings > Apps to uninstall software you no longer use. This not only frees space but also reduces background processes that slow your system.

5\. Delete Large Files You Forgot About Use File Explorer’s search filter “size:>1GB” to quickly locate large files. Move them to an external drive or delete them if no longer needed.

6\. Clean Up Browser Caches in Seconds Browser caches can consume hundreds of megabytes over time. In Chrome or Edge, press Ctrl + Shift + Delete to bring up the clear browsing data menu and remove cached images and temporary files.

7\. Defragment or Optimize Drives Regularly For HDD users, run Defragment and Optimize Drives from the Start menu to improve file access speeds. SSD users should still run Optimize periodically to trigger TRIM, which maintains performance.

8\. Disable Hibernation if Unused Hibernation stores a large hiberfil.sys file. If you never use hibernate mode, open Command Prompt as administrator and run: powercfg -h off This instantly frees several gigabytes.

9\. Remove Old Device Drivers Open Device Manager, enable “Show hidden devices” under View, and uninstall old drivers for hardware you no longer use. This cleans unnecessary driver files and registry entries.

10\. Clear Temporary Update Files If a Windows update fails or leaves residue, open Settings > Update & Security > Troubleshoot > Additional troubleshooters and run the Windows Update troubleshooter, or manually delete contents of C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\Download.

11\. Manage Startup Programs for Faster Boot Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager, go to the Startup tab, and disable non-essential programs. This speeds up boot time and reduces strain on your disk at startup.

12\. Keep the Recycle Bin Under Control Right-click the Recycle Bin, choose Properties, and set a maximum size limit. This prevents it from hoarding large amounts of space before emptying.

13\. Use [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) for One-Click Maintenance [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com) offers a 1-Click Maintenance feature that scans for junk files, broken shortcuts, temporary files, and registry errors all at once. For intermediate users, this is a huge time-saver compared to running separate tools.

14\. Remove Duplicate Files Duplicate files waste space and create confusion. Glary Utilities has a Duplicate Files Finder tool that quickly scans drives and safely removes identical files while letting you preview before deletion.

15\. Schedule Regular Cleanups Instead of waiting until performance drops, set up a weekly or monthly cleanup schedule. Using Glary Utilities’ automatic scheduler ensures junk file removal, registry repairs, and disk optimization happen without manual intervention.

By combining Windows’ built-in tools with the comprehensive features in [Glary Utilities](https://www.glarysoft.com), you can streamline your disk cleanup and optimization routine, saving significant time while keeping your PC consistently fast and responsive.
