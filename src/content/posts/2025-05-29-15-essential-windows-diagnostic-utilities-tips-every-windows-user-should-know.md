Whether you’re a casual user interested in basic troubleshooting, or an advanced user delving into in-depth analysis and optimization, mastering these system tools can save you time and prevent bigger problems down the road. Below, we explore 15 essential tips for using Windows diagnostic utilities, breaking down both beginner and advanced approaches to each.

Section 1: Diagnostic Tips for Beginners

1\. How Can You Check Your System’s Health with Windows Security? Windows Security is your first line of defense against common threats. To run a quick scan: Open Start > Settings > Update & Security > Windows Security > Virus & threat protection. Click “Quick scan” to check for viruses and malware. Regular scans help keep your PC free from malicious software.

2\. What is the Easiest Way to Free Up Disk Space? Windows' built-in Disk Cleanup tool is simple but effective: Open Start, type “Disk Cleanup,” and select the app. Choose the drive to clean and select the file types you wish to remove. This clears out temporary files, system cache, and more, boosting performance.

Tip: For a more advanced cleanup, Glary Utilities offers a 1-Click Maintenance feature that removes junk files, cleans up your registry, and optimizes system performance—all in a single click.

3\. How Do You Use Task Manager to Spot Problems? Task Manager lets you monitor processes, performance, and system resource usage: Press Ctrl+Shift+Esc to open Task Manager. Look for applications or processes hogging CPU, memory, or disk resources. Ending unresponsive tasks here can restore system responsiveness.

4\. How Can You Diagnose Internet Connection Issues Quickly? The Windows Network Troubleshooter helps resolve most connectivity problems: Open Settings > Network & Internet > Status. Click “Network troubleshooter” for automatic diagnostics and repair suggestions.

5\. Where Can You Find Basic System Information? The System Information utility provides a comprehensive overview: Press Windows+R, type “msinfo32,” and hit Enter. Review hardware specs, OS details, and driver information, which is helpful for troubleshooting or upgrades.

6\. How Can You Identify and Resolve Performance Bottlenecks? Resource Monitor gives a deeper look into system activity: Open Task Manager, go to the Performance tab, and click “Open Resource Monitor.” Analyze CPU, disk, network, and memory usage per process. Look for spikes or unusual activity to pinpoint problem applications.

7\. How Do You Use Event Viewer to Track Down System Errors? Event Viewer logs warnings, errors, and information from all system components: Press Windows+R, type “eventvwr.msc,” and press Enter. Expand “Windows Logs” and explore “System” and “Application” for recent errors. Double-click events for detailed error codes and context.

8\. What’s the Best Way to Test RAM for Faults? Windows Memory Diagnostic checks for defective RAM: Press Windows+R, type “mdsched.exe,” and press Enter. Choose to restart and check for memory problems. Review the results after reboot for any hardware issues.

9\. How Can You Check for and Fix Corrupted System Files? System File Checker (SFC) and Deployment Imaging Service and Management Tool (DISM) are powerful repair tools: Open Command Prompt as Administrator. Type “sfc /scannow” and press Enter to scan and repair system files. For deeper issues, run “DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth” to fix Windows images.

10\. How Can You Benchmark Hardware Performance? Performance Monitor provides detailed performance logs and reports: Press Windows+R, type “perfmon,” and press Enter. Set up Data Collector Sets to monitor specific counters like CPU, disk, or network over time. Analyze collected data to identify persistent slowdowns.

11\. What Are Effective Ways to Analyze Startup Problems? System Configuration (msconfig) helps isolate troublesome startup items: Press Windows+R, type “msconfig,” and press Enter. Go to the “Services” and “Startup” tabs to selectively disable items. Restart your PC to test changes and identify problem applications.

Tip: Glary Utilities provides a Startup Manager that visually lists all startup programs and lets you disable or delay unnecessary items, often with more information than msconfig alone.

12\. How Can You Monitor System Temperatures and Hardware Health? Third-party tools like HWMonitor or Open Hardware Monitor provide real-time temperature and voltage readings. Install and launch the chosen utility. Monitor CPU, GPU, and disk temperatures; overheating can cause performance drops and system crashes.

13\. How Do You Capture and Analyze System Crashes (Blue Screens)? Windows saves crash dumps for analysis. After a crash, open Event Viewer and look for “BugCheck” under System logs. Use the Windows Debugging Tools (WinDbg) to open memory dump files (“C:\\Windows\\Minidump”) and analyze the cause.

14\. How Can You Audit Driver Issues Effectively? Device Manager identifies problematic or outdated drivers: Right-click Start and choose Device Manager. Look for devices with yellow exclamation marks, indicating issues. Right-click and update, disable, or uninstall problematic drivers as needed.
